During the process we also did some analysis on tooling and came to the decision that we would use PowerShell as our automation tool of choice based on the flexibility it gave us.\nSince the initial release of solutions like Identity and Access Management in the solution guide we have included the automation as a PowerShell Procedure along-side UI Procedures to make it easy for the reader to switch between either method. One of the other reasons for doing this is that we didn't have full automation coverage for every procedure in every solution guide so it was an easy way for us to incrementally add the missing automation as it was developed.\nFor the most popular solutions we have had full coverage of automation for some time now and have recently been receiving feedback that the automation is great but there was frustration that in order to perform end-to-end deployments you either have to copy/paste procedure after procedure or create your own script to execute all steps in a single workflow. For a couple of years now we have included Sample Scripts to perform this kind of end-to-end workflow (I even wrote a number of blogs on the topic) but with them not contained within the PowerShell Module for VMware Validated Solutions itself they were not heavily tested release after release.\nIntroducing Single Execution Functions With the release of PowerValidatedSolutions v2.10.0 we decided to rectify this by adding additional functionality to enable execution in a single cmdlet. This also presented a need to extract the input data directly from the Planning and Preparation Workbook as well as an opportunity to support performing prerequisite checks prior to commencing the deployment.\nFor each of the validated solutions we now have the following functions:\nExport-???JsonSpec - Extracts data from the Planning and Preparation Workbook to a JSON specification file. Test-???Prerequisite - Reads data from the JSON specification file and performs appropriate prerequisites checks. Request-???MscaSignedCertificate - Executes the required functions to obtain or create signed-certificates from a Microsoft Certificate Authority (not required by all validated solutions). Invoke-???Deployment - Reads data from the JSON specification file and performs the installation and configuration procedures as per the implementation section of the solution guide. Invoke-Undo??Deployment - Reads data from the JSON specification file and reverses the installation and configuration procedures as per the implementation section of the solution guide. For each function we use an abbreviation for each solution see the menu screenshot below.\nIntroducing Menu Driven Execution Not only that we have built and included a simple menu to execute it all!! By executing a single command Start-ValidatedSolutionMenu you can perform all the aforementioned tasks without executing multiple command line actions.\n1Start-ValidatedSolutionMenu -jsonPath F:\\vvs\\generatedJsons\\ -certificatePath F:\\vvs\\certificates\\ -binaryPath F:\\vvs\\binaries\\ -protectedWorkbook F:\\vvs\\pnpWorkbook.xlsx -logPath F:\\vvs\\logs\\ Conclusion With the release of PowerValidatedSolutions v2.10.0 we continue to innovate and simplify consumption of the purpose build automaton to help drive time to value through a repeatable process.\nIf your getting value from this PowerShell module or you have suggestions or finding issues then please open an issue or start a discussion on the GitHub Project or leave a message on the post.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-powershell-menu/","section":"post","tags":["PowerShell","PowerValidatedSolutions","VVS"],"title":"Simplified Consumption of PowerShell Automation with VMware Validated Solutions"},{"body":"Last Updated: 28-May-2024\nWelcome to Edition #24 of the What's New for VMware Validated Solutions, this is the update for May 2024, the highlights of which are:\nNew Solution – Private AI Ready Infrastructure for VMware Cloud Foundation Added Support for VxRail to Health Reporting and Monitoring for VMware Cloud Foundation Added Support for VMware Aria Automation 8.16.2 to Private Cloud Automation for VMware Cloud Foundation Added Support for VMware Site Recovery Manager 9.0 and vSphere Replication 9.0 to Site Protection and Disaster Recovery for VMware Cloud Foundation Updated automation steps for Identity and Access Management for VMware Cloud Foundation Release of PowerValidatedSolutions v2.10.0 Private AI Ready Infrastructure for VMware Cloud Foundation Delighted to announce the release of this brand-new VMware Validated Solution.\nThe Private AI Ready Infrastructure for VMware Cloud Foundation is a well-architected validated solutions that provides enterprise private AI GPU-enabled infrastructure to build an AI platform for data scientists and ML engineers using VMware Cloud Foundation as its foundational layer.\nHealth Reporting and Monitoring for VMware Cloud Foundation The Health Reporting and Monitoring for VMware Cloud Foundation validated solution now supports Dell VxRail nodes for both consolidated and standard architectures.\nPrivate Cloud Automation for VMware Cloud Foundation The Private Cloud Automation for VMware Cloud Foundation validated solution now supports VMware Aria Automation 8.16.2.\nSite Protection and Disaster Recovery for VMware Cloud Foundation The Site Protection and Disaster Recovery for VMware Cloud Foundation validated solution now supports VMware Site Recovery Manager 9.0 and vSphere Replication 9.0.\nIdentity and Access Management for VMware Cloud Foundation The Identity and Access Management for VMware Cloud Foundation validated solution now provides a procedure for end-to-end automation using the new validated solution menu provided by the PowerShell Module for VMware Validated Solutions.

He saw that the need for automation within our customer based was growing and at the time there was no alternative solution available.\nPowerVCF Accelerated Development Towards the end of 2020 whilst working on VMware Validated Solutions I found the need to heavily consume VMware Cloud Foundations API so I started to look at PowerVCF, initially the API coverage was not great so after chatting with Brian to see where he wanted to take the module I join in his quest to expand the coverage.\nCurrent State of PowerVCF The latest release of PowerVCF (v2.4.1 at the time of writing) has significant coverage of the VMware Cloud Foundation APIs, its not however 100% and that is mainly due to our own work and personal time constraints but after 4 years of development it supports VMware Cloud Foundation 3.x up to 5.x with no major updates or pending community requests outstanding. Its also now part of an official VMware by Broadcom GitHub repository and with nearly 3000k downloads since its initial release so its usage by the community is pretty large.\nPowerCLI Buy-In for VMWare Cloud Foundation Probably around 3 years ago, Brian and myself engaged with Product Management with a view to moving PowerVCF from a community based project to an official module within PowerCLI, at the time those discussion were very positive but with one major issue which really came down to engineering resourcing. Traditionally PowerCLI cmdlets have been hand-built also following the standard PowerShell verbs but this requires engineering buy-in and of course developers to own and deliver on the asks. At the time there was no way this would happen as engineering were dealing with other more critical issues.\nPowerCLI Engineering Strategy The challenge of adding support to PowerCLI for many of the other products within the VMware by Broadcom ecosystem was starting to create a problem for our customers and there have been many community projects over the years like PowerVCF such as PowerVRA and PowerNSX to name a few which looked to solve the coverage gap PowerCLI had. This is when the PowerCLI team came up with a new approach to exposing product APIs within PowerCLI, this simply involves taking the Swagger OpenAPI spec of the product and using that to generate a bunch of cmdlets for the module. The main advantages of this are significantly lower engineering cost and most importantly 100% coverage of the public APIs.\nIntroducing PowerCLI Module for VMware Cloud Foundation With the new approach of auto-generated cmdlets the release of PowerCLI 13.2.0 on November 8 2023 saw the introduction of two new modules to support VMware Cloud Foundation:\nVMware.Sdk.Vcf.CloudBuilder VMware.Sdk.Vcf.SddcManager With the release of these two new dedicated PowerCLI modules we now have native coverage within PowerCLI and more importantly 100% coverage of the available Public APIs. There are however a few drawbacks in my view which I will share:\nThe age old rule of rubbish in rubbish out, having spent the last few years hand building cmdlets for PowerVCF and PowerValidatedSolutions I've seen first hand that if the API swagger spec or documentation in general is poorly written it can be very hard to work out how to use the cmdlets. Usage of the cmdlets is not as intuitive, first and foremost the cmdlets follow either the Intialize-Vcf??? or Invoke-Vcf??? format, they then simply consume the operation ID from the swagger spec. This means you need to be familiar with the API documentation or at least need to consult it whilst developing your automation to understand the name of the cmdlet you need to perform a task. For example the PowerCLI cmdlet Invoke-VcfGetSddcManager would be the equivalent of Get-VCFManager in PowerVCF. The PowerCLI engineering team are responsible for building the modules but they do not perform end-to-end testing, so as per my first point its possible you could find unknown issues. Conclusion With the release of VMware.Sdk.Vcf.CloudBuilder and VMware.Sdk.Vcf.SddcManager native to PowerCLI PowerCLI 13.2.0 we have a PowerShell module fully supported by VMware Global Support and providing 100% coverage of the Public APIs.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-powercli-main/","section":"post","tags":["VCF"],"title":"Native PowerCLI Modules for VMware Cloud Foundation"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/categories/powercli/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"PowerCLI"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/series/powercli-module-for-vmware-cloud-foundation/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"PowerCLI Module for VMware Cloud Foundation"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/categories/powershell/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"PowerShell"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/vcf/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"VCF"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/categories/vmware-cloud-foundation/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"VMware Cloud Foundation"},{"body":"Last Updated: 26-March-2024\nWelcome to Edition #23 of the What's New for VMware Validated Solutions, this is the update for March 2024, the highlights of which are:\nAdded support for VMware Cloud Foundation 5.1.1 for all VMware Validated Solutions Update to password management for the latest Photon OS Various enhancements to Intelligent Operations Management for VMware Cloud Foundation Various enhancements to Intelligent Network Visibility for VMware Cloud Foundation Various enhancements to Private Cloud Automation for VMware Cloud Foundation Various enhancements to Site Protection and Disaster Recovery for VMware Cloud Foundation Various enhancements to Cloud-Based Workload Protection for VMware Cloud Foundation Various enhancements to Cloud-Based Ransomware Recovery for VMware Cloud Foundation Various enhancements to Cross Cloud Mobility for VMware Cloud Foundation Release of PowerValidatedSolutions v2.9.0 Added Support for VMware Cloud Foundation 5.1.1 Delighted to announce support for VMware Cloud Foundation 5.1.1 for the following VMware Validated Solutions:\nIdentity and Access Management for VMware Cloud Foundation Developer Ready Infrastructure for VMware Cloud Foundation Intelligent Logging and Analytics for VMware Cloud Foundation Intelligent Operations Management for VMware Cloud Foundation Intelligent Network Visibility for VMware Cloud Foundation Private Cloud Automation for VMware Cloud Foundation Site Protection and Disaster Recovery for VMware Cloud Foundation Health Reporting and Monitoring for VMware Cloud Foundation Cloud-Based Workload Protection for VMware Cloud Foundation Cloud-Based Ransomware Recovery for VMware Cloud Foundation Cross Cloud Mobility for VMware Cloud Foundation Password Management Updates Several of the virtual appliances have moved from Photon v3 to v4 resulting in changes to the way password complexity and account lockout policies are configured as a result the relevant sections of each validated solution have been modified to reflect the new configuration files.

In part one we discussed downloading the bundles to SDDC Manager to prepare the system for the upgrade process, in this post we discuss performing the upgrade pre-checks.\nEnsuring your VMware Cloud Foundation instance is healthy prior to starting an upgrade is critical to a successful upgrade, SDDC Manager itself has a pre-check process which is executed on a per workload domain basis. Depending on the version of VMware Cloud Foundation your upgrading from this pre-check has seen some significant improvements over time. In addition to executing the specific workload domain pre-check at the SDDC Manager level our team released a PowerShell Module last year called VMware.CloudFoundation.Reporting which can be utilized in conjunction with the internal pre-check to perform additional health checks prior to starting an upgrade step.\nMy recommendation would be to carry out the following steps before commencing with the any upgrade:\nStep 1 - Run a Health Report using Invoke-VcfHealthReport Step 2 - Run an Alert Report using Invoke-VcfAlertReport Step 3 - Run an initial SDDC Manager System Pre-Check for each Workload Domain For detailed instructions on installed and using VMware.CloudFoundation.Reporting refer to the GitHub Documentation.\nVMware Cloud Foundation APIs Used\nGET /v1/system/prechecks/tasks/{id} POST /v1/system/prechecks PowerVCF Cmdlets\nStart-VCFSystemPrecheck Get-VCFSystemPrecheckTask PowerShell Scripts\nstartSystemPrecheck.ps1 Run a Health Report using Invoke-VcfHealthReport Procedure\nStart Windows PowerShell.\nReplace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.\n1$sddcManagerFqdn = \u0026#34;lax-vcf01.lax.rainpole.io\u0026#34; 2$sddcManagerUser = \u0026#34;administrator@vsphere.local\u0026#34; 3$sddcManagerPass = \u0026#34;VMw@re1!\u0026#34; 4$sddcManagerLocalUser = \u0026#34;vcf\u0026#34; 5$sddcManagerLocalPass = \u0026#34;VMw@re1!\u0026#34; 6$reportPath = \u0026#34;F:\\Reporting\\LAX\u0026#34; Run a Health Report by running the following command: 1Invoke-VcfHealthReport -sddcManagerFqdn $sddcManagerFqdn -sddcManagerUser $sddcManagerUser -sddcManagerPass $sddcManagerPass -sddcManagerLocalUser $sddcManagerLocalUser -sddcManagerLocalPass $sddcManagerLocalPass -reportPath $reportPath -allDomains -failureOnly Review the Health Report and investigate any issues identified.

This is an internal service account used by vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager to make vCenter Server API calls and is rotated automatically by SDDC Manager.\nThis duplication of accounts happens due to the fact that there is no way to update the existing record and so SDDC Manager has to create a new account when the rotation process occurs. In theory it should then remove the previous account, I checked with a member of the engineering team and this would appear to be a bug which I have reported.\nHowever, all is not lost as the extra accounts can be safely deleted without any impact to the system. vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager has a neat implementation here that can help us easily identify which accounts are no longer required through an 'In Use' flag which blocks a user from removing an account that is referenced by another object.\nRemoving an Account from the Password Locker UI Procedure Log in to vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager at https://\u0026lt;vrealize_suite_lifecycle_manager_fqdn\u0026gt; as vcfadmin@local.\nOn the My services page, click Locker.\nIn the left pane, click Passwords.\nLocate the password alias with VCF-password-\u0026lt;guid\u0026gt;, click the ellipses at the end of the row and select Delete Password.\nChances are your looking at this blog post because you don't just have one or two of these old accounts hanging around in the Password Locker but a significant amount or perhaps you want to add some automation to perform regular clean up if so then here is a very simple PowerShell scripts I've put together.\nNOTE\nThis script requires the PowerShell Module PowerValidatedSolution which can be installed directly from the Microsoft PSGallery.

Not every VMware customer is a consumer of VMware Cloud Foundation and these products such as NSX and vRealize Suite can be consumed without VMware Cloud Foundation in the mix and so each of these business groups have their own drivers and commitments to keep on top of supporting and working with the VMware Cloud Foundation engineering teams. As a consequence of this and not forgetting a multitude of different release dates, all of these factors have an impact on the BoM that lands for VMware Cloud Foundation at its release date where a significant amount of workflow testing has to be carried out with the slightest of BoM changes.\nWhy am I telling you all this? Well, I think it’s important that you as a customer have an appreciation of the complex nature in which the VMware Cloud Foundation engineering teams operate on a daily basis. With all of the aforementioned challenges around BoM interoperability and working on VMware Cloud Foundation features and enhancements sometimes tough decisions have to be made by the Product Management team, and such an example concerns VMware Cloud Foundation 4.5.1 and the version of vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager it deploys.\nI’m not privy to the background behind this particular decision, I myself just came to know recently based on some VMware Validated Solution related work, but if you're deploying VMware Cloud Foundation 4.5.1 you will be deploying vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 8.8.2 which as it turns out went what VMware calls End of General Support (EOGS) on 2023-04-28 (see VMware Product Lifecycle Matrix).\nWhat does this all mean? This basically means you as the customer must upgrade vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager immediately to remain within the scope of general support before proceeding with deploying any additional vRealize Suite products.\nThis VMware KB article KB88829 was created when the flexible BoM was introduced but if you have looked at it recently you will have noticed that its starting to look a little bit complex. As a result for the July 2023 update to the vRealize Suite based VMware Validated Solutions along with introducing support for VMware Cloud Foundation 5.0 we decided to include a new section to help navigate these complexities.\nThe basic essence is to direct the user on what needs to be done for either VMware Cloud Foundation 4.5.1 or VMware Cloud Foundation 5.0.0 to vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager to upgrade or patch to a consistent version this being vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 8.10 PATCH1 with Product Support Pack 14.\nDetails for each VMware Validated Solution can be found using the following links:\nIntelligent Logging and Analytics for VMware Cloud Foundation Deployment of vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager for Intelligent Logging and Analytics for VMware Cloud Foundation Intelligent Operations Management for VMware Cloud Foundation Deployment of vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager and Workspace ONE Access for Intelligent Operations Management for VMware Cloud Foundation Private Cloud Automation for VMware Cloud Foundation Deployment of vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager and Workspace ONE Access for Private Cloud Automation for VMware Cloud Foundation Within these sections you will find a table for each VMware Cloud Foundation release which directs you through the steps that you follow to deploy and upgrade the relevant components consuming either content from the official VMware Cloud Foundation Administration Guide or a new library of procedures developed by the VMware Validated Solutions team directly in the solution guide.\nAfter following these procedures the highest versions of the vRealize Suite components will be as follows:\nComponent Version vRealize Log Insight v8.10.2\nvRealize Operations v8.10.2\nvRealize Automation v8.11.2\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-vrslcm-upgrade/","section":"post","tags":["Aria Suite Lifecycle","vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager","VVS"],"title":"Upgrading vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager with VMware Cloud Foundation"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/vrealize-suite-lifecycle-manager/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"VRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager"},{"body":"Last Updated 25-Jul-2023 VMware Validated Solutions are byte sized solutions developed to extend the foundational capabilities of VMware Cloud Foundation, for background reading see my previous post here.

Flexible release cycle as not tied directly to PowerValidatedSolution releases. Aligned with other Validated Operations initiatives where we have. As a result I have the pleasure of announcing today the release of the new PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Password Management which can be downloaded from the Microsoft PowerShell Gallery as with all of our open-source modules where it's known as VMware.CloudFoundation.PasswordManagement\nFor this initial release we have focused on transitioning all of the functions from PowerValidatedSolutions to VMware.CloudFoundation.PasswordManagement but we have plans to enhance further in the coming months.\nInstalling the PowerShell Module Installing VMware.CloudFoundation.PasswordManagement is very simple just like other PowerShell modules you use the Install-Module cmdlet.\n1Install-Module -Name VMware.CloudFoundation.PasswordManagement However if you have previously used PowerValidatedSolutions then you should be aware that you will need to remove all existing versions from your system to avoid any conflicts between the exported function names as we have simply removed them from PowerValidatedSolutions and added them into the new VMware.CloudFoundation.PasswordManagement module. This can be done using the Uninstall-Module cmdlet.\n1Uninstall-Module -Name PowerValidatedSolutions -RequiredVersion 2.1.1.1000 You supply the full version during the uninstall process, if your not sure what versions are installed on your system for Windows you can look in the C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\PowerValidatedSolutions folder, this assumes you are using the default path to install PowerShell modules.\nVerifying Module Prerequisites The usage of the VMware.CloudFoundation.PasswordManagement module requires a number of other supporting PowerShell modules to also be installed, this is documented within the GitHub README.md but as part of the switch to a dedicated module we have also introduced the new Test-VcfPasswordManagementPrereq cmdlet which you can run to check these prerequisites before attempting to use the main cmdlets to generate reports or perform the configuration.\n1Test-VcfPasswordManagementPrereq Execution of the PowerShell Module From an execution perspective this remains unchanged from the same as it was in January, I've already written a few blogs which you can check out:\nPassword Policy Configuration for VMware Cloud Foundation Overview Generating Password Policy Reports for VMware Cloud Foundation Configure Password Policies for VMware Cloud Foundation Support and Feedback To report issues, obtain support, or suggest enhancements to the open-source PowerShell Module, use GitHub Issues in the GitHub repository.\nOther Open-source Modules PowerShell Module for the VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x API PowerShell Module for VMware Validated Solutions PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Reporting PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Password Management PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Power Management ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-password-management/","section":"post","tags":["API","PowerShell","VCF"],"title":"Introducing a PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Password Management"},{"body":" It's been a while since the last update but I'm pleased to announce the general availability of PowerVCF v2.3.0 for download from the Microsoft PowerShell Library.

Using this web-based application you can import a previous JSON file, create a new JSON file from scratch and export ready for use with VMware Cloud Builder.\nThe big win here is that the web-based application also allows us to perform extensive validation across all inputs, something which is limited in the Deployment Parameter Workbook today due to not wanting to use VBScript which would introduce a security risk on the Excel workbook.\nWhat this ultimately means is that when the JSON file is created using the web-based application and then passed to VMware Cloud Builder, you don't end up getting validation failures based on things like password complexity or IP subnet validations, instead all of these types of validation tasks should simply succeed leaving the physical infrastructure validations to proceed exposing real issues that may impact the Bring-up process.\nAs already mentioned VMware Cloud Foundation Configuration File Generator is shipped as a containerized web application which can be run on VMware Fusion/Workstation or Docker Desktop with ease.\nWith the initial release, we have provided two versions of the containerized application to support the current releases of VMware Cloud Foundation. This is required as between the releases some changes have occurred within the JSON specification so we decided to handle this through version specific releases, the idea being the the web-based application could be tied to a VMware Cloud Builder release. Versions supported are:\nVMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.x VMware Cloud Foundation 4.5.x It's also worth calling out that with the current release of VMware Cloud Foundation Configuration File Generator we only support vSAN Ready Nodes and not VxRail Nodes, like any Fling we had to make some calls early in the development process to lock down the scope, otherwise these projects can become very open ended and nothing gets delivered.\nWe believe the work done on this Fling will provide our customers and partners significant value, of course time will tell so if you have feedback or comments please leave them on the Fling page. Don't delay download today!\nA BIG THANK YOU to the team involved in making this happen, Bohdan Karabadzhak, Nikola Tomevski, Todor Todorov and Alexander Nenkov, its been a pleasure working with you all on this project.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-fling-cfg/","section":"post","tags":["VCF"],"title":"New Fling - VMware Cloud Foundation Configuration File Generator"},{"body":"In a recent blog (see here) I provided an overview of Password Policy Configuration for VMware Cloud Foundation, in this blog we will take a deep dive on using Start-PasswordPolicyConfig which actually performs the configuration of all password policies across the VMware Cloud Foundation instance.\nThe Start-PasswordPolicyConfig cmdlet is part of the PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Password Management and provides the ability to automate the configuration of password policies using the provided configuration JSON for the following components:\nESXi vCenter Single Sign-On vCenter Server NSX Manager NSX Edge SDDC Manager The cmdlet has the following command line parameters:\nCLI Parameters Required Description sddcManagerFqdn required FQDN for SDDC Manager appliance sddcManagerUser required User account for SDDC Manager with ADMIN role sddcManagerPass required Password for the SDDC Manager user sddcRootPass required Password of the root account reportPath required Folder location where reports are created and configuration JSON file resides policyFile optional Name of the configuration JSON file used set the configuration Now lets take a look at an example of how to run the configuration.\nConfigure Password Policies for All Workload Domains Start Windows PowerShell.

For this report we use the following command line parameters:\nsddcManagerFqdn sddcManagerUser sddcManagerPass sddcRootPass reportPath allDomains darkMode drift policyFile Because we are comparing the current configuration of each component against a desired state configuration we must first create a configuration JSON file and then update the values to align to the desired state settings. For this the PowerShell Module for VMware Validated Solutions provides another handy cmdlet called Get-PasswordPolicyDefault, this can be used to create the initial JSON file using the VMware product defaults which you then update accordingly.\nCreate Configuration JSON File and Generate Password Policy Manager Report with Configuration Drift\nStart Windows PowerShell. Change to the report folder. 1cd F:\\Reporting Run the commands in the PowerShell console 1Get-PasswordPolicyDefault -generateJson -jsonFile \u0026#39;passwordPolicyConfig.json\u0026#39; Open the generated configuration JSON file and updated with desired values and save. Run the commands in the PowerShell console 1 Invoke-PasswordPolicyManager -sddcManagerFqdn \u0026#39;sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io\u0026#39; -sddcManagerUser \u0026#39;admin@local\u0026#39; -sddcManagerPass \u0026#39;VMw@re1!VMw@re1!\u0026#39; -sddcRootPass \u0026#39;VMw@re1!\u0026#39; -reportPath \u0026#39;F:\\Reporting\u0026#39; -darkMode -allDomains -drift -policyFile \u0026#39;PasswordPolicyConfig.json\u0026#39; Console Output - Example Report 2\nThis screenshot displays the output of the Invoke-PasswordPolicyManager cmdlet on the console, you will see its the same as the first report the difference this time is the output generated in the HTML report. HTML Report - Example Report 2\nThis time when the report is generated we are presented with the same format and layout as that of the standard report, the difference now is that for each parameter displayed its compared against the configuration JSON file and if a difference is found an additional value is shown within [] brackets. The value contained within the [] is the desired state configuration value, if you see these values it means that the system is not compliant with the desired state configuration and that some reconfiguration work is required. Conclusion Using the Invoke-PasswordPolicyManager cmdlet contained within the PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Password Management you can now easily generate a report to capture the current state configuration of all components across a VMware Cloud Foundation instance, and you can also compare the configuration against the desired state configuration to identify remediation work.\nIf you have feedback, suggestions or want to report an issues with using the PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Password Management visit GitHub and open an issue\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-password-policy-reports/","section":"post","tags":["API","PowerShell","VVS"],"title":"Generating Password Policy Reports for VMware Cloud Foundation"},{"body":"Last Updated: 25-Apr-2023\nPassword Policy Configuration may not be that important to some but for security teams it’s critical for ensuring their organization is protected. If you have ever looked deep into this area when it comes to VMware Cloud Foundation and the components involved you will quickly realize that unfortunately VMware today does not make things easy for our customers. We have:\nlack of consistency with default values lack of consistency with common parameters lack of consistency with API methods lack of consistency with terminology and language This is why with the January Update to VMware Validated Solutions (see here) we have spent a significant amount of time reviewing and rewriting all aspects of our content as it relates to Password Policy Configuration.\nThe first hurdle we needed to address related to terminology, after digging through product documentation, user interfaces and general pocking around it became clear that Password Policies can be consistently thrown into three main buckets as follows:\nPassword Expiration Password Complexity Account Lockout Once we had this defined we found it much easier to understand and capture the specifics on a product by product basis.\nThe second hurdle involved establishing what methods were required in order to review or alter the various policy parameters by product.\nThe outcome of this work has resulted firstly in a completely new section, Password Policy Configuration for VMware Cloud Foundation being added into the VMware Cloud Foundation Operations Guide. The new content includes procedures for configuring password expiration, password complexity and account lockout through the user interface and PowerShell using the PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Password Management providing coverage for:\nESXi vCenter Server NSX SDDC Manager And secondly from a VMware Validated Solution perspective enhancements have been included to the Identity and Access Management for VMware Cloud Foundation, these enhancements include:\nDesign decisions for password expiration, password complexity and account lockout password policies for: ESXi vCenter Server NSX SDDC Manager Workspace ONE Access Operational guidance for the configuration of password expiration, password complexity and account lockout password policies. Operational guidance for performing Password Policy Configuration with the Password Policy Manager in PowerShell. What is Password Policy Manager? Password Policy Manager essentially refers to the collection of PowerShell functions which when combined enable you to automate one of the following use cases:\nGenerate a clarity based HTML report to capture the current state of the password expiration, password complexity and account lockout policies across a VMware Cloud Foundation instance. Generate a clarity based HTML report to compare the current state of the password expiration, password complexity and account lockout policies across a VMware Cloud Foundation instance with desired state config defined in a JSON file. Configure password expiration, password complexity and account lockout policies across a VMware Cloud Foundation instance using the desired state config defined in a JSON file. In a future post I will provide more information on how to use Password Policy Manager specifically but for now the key functions to be aware of are:\nInvoke-PasswordPolicyManager – a dedicated cmdlet to generate the HTML reports with or without configuration drift. Start-PasswordPolicyConfig – a dedicated cmdlet to configure your organization’s password policy requirements across the platform.

The obvious answer is to include products such as vRealize Operations or vRealize Log Insight but what if there was a simpler way to gain some insights into the health without the need to implement and manage additional components?\nWell now there is and its called PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Reporting!\nMyself and number of colleagues earlier this year were working with one of our largest customers and were asked to investigate if there was anything we could do to help accelerate through automation the ability to perform a health check across a VMware Cloud Foundation instance, working with our Professional Services Organization they had already developed an extensive run book with manual procedures but the end-to-end process was very time consuming. As a team we had been working on the automation of VMware Validated Solutions for the last twelve months using PowerShell and it was immediately obvious that some of the work could be reused so we set about building a dedicated PowerShell module for reporting purposes.\nIntroducing PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Reporting The PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Reporting is a VMware Open-source project located on Github, the PowerShell module is published to the Microsoft PS Gallery as VMware.CloudFoundation.Reporting and earlier this week we released version v1.0.5 which adds some improvements and addresses some issues identified.\nThe module was initially developed to produce a Health Report, but after we had developed the framework for producing a clarity based HTML we decided that adding some additional report types further increased the value of our work. Here's what we provide:\n1. Overview Report This report contains high-level information about the VMware Cloud Foundation instance and can provide a quick overview of the system to your VMware representative. 2. Health Report This report combines the SoS Utility health checks with additional health checks not presently available in the SoS Utility for previous VMware Cloud Foundation releases. The report contains detailed information about the health of the VMware Cloud Foundation instance and its components. 3. Alert Report This report collects information about the system alerts that are currently active in the VMware Cloud Foundation instance for the platform components. This report reduces the need to login to multiple product interfaces to collect information about the system alerts. 4. Password Policy Report This report collects information about the password policy settings in a VMware Cloud Foundation instance for the platform components. 5. Configuration Report This report collects information about the configuration settings in a VMware Cloud Foundation instance for the platform components. 6. Upgrade Pre-Check Report This report initiates an upgrade precheck of a workload domain using the REST API and presents the results in an HTML report. This allows you to start the precheck from the PowerShell console. For further details on how to use VMware.CloudFoundation.Reporting refer to the README.md within the installation folder on your system after you have installed using Install-Module -Name VMware.CloudFoundation.Reporting or review it directly on the GitHub repository.\nIf you have suggestions or find any issues then please report them on the GitHub repository.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-cloud-reporting/","section":"post","tags":["VCF","PowerShell"],"title":"Generating Health Reports for VMware Cloud Foundation"},{"body":"Last Updated: 29-Nov-2022\nWelcome to Edition #11 of the What's New for VMware Validated Solutions, today we announced the following updates:\nAdded improvements to the implementation prerequisites across all VMware Validated Solutions Added improvements to PowerShell functions for Site Protection and Disaster Recovery for VMware Cloud Foundation Added certificate replacement procedures for Cloud-Based Automation for VMware Cloud Foundation Release of PowerValidatedSolutions v1.10.0, our PowerShell module developed to ensure robustness, consistency, and accelerate implementation Added Implementation Prerequisites Improvements Following feedback we have incorporated improvements to the implementation prerequisites section of each solution guide.

Getting early visibility that passwords are due to expire has a significant impact on the workload of a Site Resiliency Engineer (SRE) in that it allows them to plan for password rotation operations ahead of time rather than dealing with a reactive situation where a password has actually expired.\nNow whilst SDDC Manager enables you to perform manual or automated password rotation operations it still lacks the ability to view and configure password policies such as complexity, expiration and account lockout. The main point here being that whilst SDDC Manager can inform of an impending expiration if you have not altered the default password expiration policy for each products default setting you may be forced into rotating passwords inconsistently across the Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC).\nIt's not my place to advise customers on the password expiration policy they should be applying to the SDDC components, this should be defined by their compliance team. What I can do however is provide some guidance on how to be successful which is the purpose of this blog post.\nLet's take a closer look at some of the details contained within the Expiring within 14 days widget in the SDDC Manager UI, in the image below you can see that we have 9 x NSX Edge and 4 x NSX Manager passwords that are flagged as expiring within the next 14 days. If we now take a closer look at the NSXT Manager and NSXT Edge component view under the Password Management section of the SDDC Manager UI we can see exactly which accounts and on which components are affected.\nNSXT Manager NSXT Edge Great, so what next! Well you have two options really, you can either Rotate Passwords using the SDDC Manager UI or you could amend the password expiration policy. As this is our internal lab and we have full control to configure or define things how we like and rotating passwords often becomes more difficult to manage I wanted to investigate adjusting the password expiration policy so that I could apply a single consistent policy across all components.\nThe first step is to understand how NSX handles password expiration, this is a summary of my findings (see here):\nDefault max days is 90 across both NSX Manager and NSX Edge Nodes Max days value is configured on a per user basis (root, admin, audit, guestuser1 and guestuser2) Max days can be set using the set user nsxcli or via REST API Armed with the above details I quickly realized that making this adjustment across my lab which contains two NSX Managers, four NSX Edge nodes each of which containing five accounts was not going to be a very quick process and knowing that some of our customers have many Workload Domains or VMware Cloud Foundation instances I decided to investigate automating the process.\nThe solution is a combination of VMware Cloud Foundation and NSX public REST APIs, combining them into a few functions we can deliver a single script that can automate applying a new Password Expiration Policy across a single VMware Cloud Foundation instance, Workload Domain and the your choice of accounts.\nDownload from Github the updateNsxtPasswordExpirationPolicy.ps1 script.\nConfiguring the Password Expiration Policy for NSX Manager and Edge Nodes Start Windows PowerShell.\nReplace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.\n1$sddcManagerFqdn = \u0026#34;sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io\u0026#34; 2$sddcManagerUser = \u0026#34;administrator@vsphere.local\u0026#34; 3$sddcManagerPass = \u0026#34;VMw@re1!\u0026#34; 4 5$sddcDomain = \u0026#34;sfo-m01\u0026#34; 6$nsxtAccounts = @(\u0026#34;root\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;audit\u0026#34;) 7$passwordChangeFrequency = 999 Perform the configuration by running the command in the PowerShell console. 1.\\updateNsxtPasswordExpirationPolicy -server $sddcManagerFqdn -username $sddcManagerUser -password $sddcManagerPass -nsxtAccounts $nsxtAccounts -passwordChangeFrequency $passwordChangeFrequency Refresh the Password Management section of the SDDC Manager UI, the NSXT Manager and NSXT Edge counters should no longer appear in the Expiring within 14 days widget. And there you have it, I now have a single password expiration policy defined and applied to all NSX components managed by my SDDC Manager and the current password expiration warning are addressed. Next time I see the expiration warnings it really will be time for me to rotate my passwords to remain compliant.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-nsxt-password-expiration/","section":"post","tags":["VCF","NSX"],"title":"Configure Password Expiration Policy for NSX Manager/Edge Nodes for a VMware Cloud Foundation Instance"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/nsx/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"NSX"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/categories/nsx-t-data-center/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"NSX-T Data Center"},{"body":"By default Workspace ONE Access passwords (root, sshuser) are set to expire after 60 days. Unless you rotate passwords on regular basis you may have overlooked this default configuration and suddenly find yourself locked out of being able to perform management tasks.\nVMware Cloud Foundation provides the ability to perform scheduled or manual password rotations something to consider looking into from a day-to-day operational process but if your passwords have already expired this won't help as the VMware Cloud Foundation password rotation workflow can no longer authenticate.\nIt's also worth pointing out that VMware Cloud Foundation also does not support the password rotation of the sshuser account either so using SDDC Manager is only going to help solve part of problem.\nAll is not lost, here I provide the fastest way to get the environment working again, this involves resetting the root and sshuser accounts back to the original passwords.\nResolving Expired Passwords for Workspace ONE Access Nodes Log in to the management domain vCenter Server at https://\u0026lt;management_vcenter_server_fqdn\u0026gt;/ui as administrator@vsphere.local.\nIn the Hosts and Clusters inventory, navigate to the default management data center, expand the data center and cluster objects.\nLocate and select the Workspace ONE Access virtual appliance, in the Summary page click Launch Web Console.\nLogin to the console as root, you will be forced to change the password due to it expiring.

I first took a look at Terraform in late 2020 while doing some research around automating VMware Validated Solutions, at the time there were far too many gaps in the providers which made it difficult to justify its use to deliver end to end automation with very short time scales. Jumping forward to today, there has been a lot of traction over the last 24 months with new providers being released as well as enhancements to existing providers and with less time pressures its felt like a good time to roll up my sleeves and dig deeper into what Terraform can do for me now.\nI'm not a Terraform expert by any stretch of the imagination and I certainly don't pretend to be one, and in truth its taken me a while to get my head around the Terraform concepts but the idea of this post is to try and share what I've learnt by explaining in a way that has made sense to me. Hopefully it will help others at least get their heads around the basics and allow them to flourish in their development of Terraform plans.\nTerraform Install First things first, you will need to intsall Terraform on your operating system of choice. For this I would recommend using the Terraform documentation where you will find a number of methods that can be followed.\nTerraform Concepts Let's now take a look at some basic concepts, this is not an exhaustive list but should be enough to get you going.\nFiles and Directories\nTerraform code is stored as plain text within files that have a .tf file extension. All files are kept together within a single directory which is referred to as a module and Terraform evaluates all of these configuration files treating the entire module as a single document.\nTip\nUse Terraform's ability to read multiple .tf files as part of the module, this allows you to split out elements of the code into smaller and easier to manage files.\nResources\nA resource describes the infrastructure object being created or modified and as such are considered the most important element.\nData Sources\nData sources relate to objects defined outside of Terraform.\nProviders\nProviders are referred to as plugins which are used to interact with the infrastructure, each provider adds a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage.\nWithout providers, Terraform can't manage any kind of infrastructure, they are distributed separately from Terraform itself.\nVariables and Outputs\nInput variables allow you to customize the code without making changes to the source code. Output values are used to return values from the code which can be used by other modules. Terraform also has the concept of temporary variables which are referred to as local variables.\nBuilt in Functions\nThe Terraform language includes a number of built-in functions which can be called to transform and combine values.\nTerraform CLI The command line interface (CLI) to Terraform is via the terraform command, which accepts a variety of subcommands such as terraform init or terraform plan. For a full breakdown of Terraform CLI commands refer to the the Terraform CLI Documentation but here are a few common ones you should get familiar with:\nValidates the configuration files in a directory, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs\n1terraform validate Formats the configuration files to a canonical format and style\n1terraform fmt Initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files\n1terraform init Creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure\n1terraform plan -out=tfplan Executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan\n1terraform apply tfplan Destroys all remote objects managed by a particular Terraform configuration\n1terraform destroy Conclusion In this post we have only scratched the surface of Terraform, but if you can get your head around these basics as you start playing with Terraform yourself you will quickly become familar with additional functionality and will be writing more complex Terraform code in no time.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/terraform/terraform-intro/","section":"post","tags":["Terraform"],"title":"Terraform - Learning Some Basics"},{"body":"With the release of VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.0, VMware removed a number of the vRealize Suite of products from the Bill of Materials (BoM) with the intent of providing customers more flexibility. For more details refer to Flexible vRealize Suite product upgrades of the What's New section of the release notes.\nWhilst this is great news for our customers, it has led to a bit of confusion. The release notes simply state:\nQuote\nYou can use vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager to deploy vRealize Automation, vRealize Operations Manager, vRealize Log Insight, and Workspace ONE Access. vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager determines which versions of these products are compatible and only allows you to install/upgrade to supported versions.\nThe underlying issue here is that customers can no longer use the Product Interoperability Matrix to easily identify the correct version mix between VMware Cloud Foundation itself and anything greater than vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 8.6.2, this is due to that fact that patches for vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager are required and these are not part of the search criteria.\nIn an attempt to help drive clarity a new VMware KB article has been created KB88829, this can be used to work out the upgrade path for vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager that is needed to then be able to deploy a later release of vRealize Suite product on top of VMware Cloud Foundation.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-vrealize-flexibility/","section":"post","tags":["VCF"],"title":"VMware Cloud Foundation and vRealize Suite Flexibility"},{"body":"Ever been in the situation where your licenses assigned in VMware Cloud Foundation are due to expire, well whilst doing some work this week in the lab I noticed that some of mine were coming up for expiration, which got me wondering what the process was to remedy. If you have been in this situation, you probably like me started by checking out the License Management section of the VMware Cloud Foundation Administration Guide and like me ended up being disappointed to find that it only covers the following topics:\nAdding a License Key Editing a License Key Description Removing a License Key Next I did a quick google which also turned up little to no information, challenge accepted!!\nIn this post we will take a look at the steps involved, my focus and testing has been isolated to the vSAN License. Time permitting I plan to look at other areas such as NSX-T Data Center and Tanzu.\nFirst thing to call out here is that unfortunately the process is not automated from an SDDC Manager perspective, the only thing that SDDC Manager does do is automatically updates the assignment in its inventory once the new licenses are added to both vCenter Server and SDDC Manager.\nSo lets take a look at the detailed steps, from a high-level the process is as follows:\nIdentify the Expiring vSAN License Adding a New vSAN License to SDDC Manager Adding a New vSAN License to vCenter Server Reassign the vSAN License in vCenter Server Remove the Expiring vSAN License from vCenter Server Remove the Expiring vSAN License from SDDC Manager Identify the Expiring vSAN License Login to SDDC Manager UI. From the navigation, expand Administration and select Licensing. Identity the license that is expiring and make a note of the license key, and the current used allocation. Adding a New vSAN License to SDDC Manager Login into the SDDC Manager UI. From the navigation, expand Administration and select Licensing. Click the + License Key button. On the Add License Key dialog, using the Product Name dropdown select VMware vSAN. In the License Key text box, enter the new license key. In the Description text box, enter a description for the key. Click Add. Adding a New vSAN License to vCenter Server Login into the Management Domain vCenter Server. From the Home menu, select Administration. Under Licensing, select Licenses. Select the License tab, click Add. On the Enter License Keys dialog, enter the new license key and click Next. On the Edit license names dialog, enter a license name and click Next. On the Ready to Complete dialog, click Finish. Reassign the vSAN License in vCenter Server Login into the Management Domain vCenter Server. From the Home menu, select Administration. Under Licensing, select Licenses. Select the Assets tab, and click vSAN Clusters. Select the cluster you want to reassign the license for and click Assign License. On the Assign License dialog, select te new license key and click OK. Remove the Expiring vSAN License from vCenter Server Login into the Management Domain vCenter Server. From the Home menu, select Administration. Under Licensing, select Licenses. Select the License tab. Select the expiring license and click Remove. Remove the Expiring vSAN License from SDDC Manager Login into the SDDC Manager UI. From the navigation, expand Administration and select Licensing. Verify that the old license now has a used count of zero and the new licenses used count has gone up. Click the ellipses next to the expired license and select Remove. On the Remove license key dialog, click Remove. That's it, you have now successfully replaced and cleaned up the the expiring vSAN license.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-license-update/","section":"post","tags":["VCF"],"title":"Updating a vSAN License in VMware Cloud Foundation"},{"body":"By default NSX-T Data Center passwords (root, admin and audit) on the NSX Manager and NSX Edge nodes are set to expire after 90 days. Unless you rotate passwords on regular basis you may have overlooked this default configuration and suddenly find yourself locked out of being able to perform management tasks.\nFirstly in more recent releases, VMware Cloud Foundation provides the ability to perform scheduled or manual password rotations something to consider looking into from a day-to-day operational process but if your passwords have already expired all bets are off as the VMware Cloud Foundation password rotation workflow can no longer authenticate. Thinking the password rotation feature may be a way out very quickly presents you with the following error message:\nDescription: Password update for resource : sfo-m01-nsx01.sfo.rainpole.io, user : admin and credential type : API\nMessage: Failed to get NSXT user details\nRemediation Message: Please verify that the account is active and is not locked. If the password of the account has expired, manually reset the password in the product and then perform a REMEDIATE operation in the SDDC Manager, to update its stored copy of the password.\nReference Token: HDDF8C\nCause: The credentials were incorrect or the account specified has been locked.\nIn a fairly small deployment the process of resetting the passwords is not a speedy process, for example in a Standard Architecture deployment of VMware Cloud Foundation with a single NSX Edge Cluster deployed in each Workload Domain the NSX Appliance count is already a total of ten (10). Not withstanding this, personally I found very little information on the internet that explained a single end-to-end process or in fact the best approach in order to rectify the situation. For example the message from VMware Cloud Foundation itself suggests a number of steps, including the remediate option which frankly just adds further time to the process.\nBecause of this I decided to spend a little bit of time investigating the options with a view to documenting what I found to be the fastest approach to get things unblocked. In essence this really boils down to adjusting the expiration policy to never expire initially, it removes the need to manually update all of the passwords and then perform remediation within VMware Cloud Foundation and once your unblocked you can either continue using the original passwords and the never expire policy setting or look to use a combination of VMware Cloud Foundation scheduled password rotations and a complementary expiration timeline.\nLet's take a look at the process I followed in my lab, which involves a combination of nsxcli commands executed on the console and some cmdlets that have been recently added to PowerValidatedSolutions which use the NSX REST APIs.\nResolving Expired Passwords for an NSX Management Cluster The first step in the process is unlocking the NSX Management Cluster, this has to be done through a console on one of the NSX Manager appliances, the good news though is that as this is a cluster you only need to make the change on one of the NSX Manager nodes.\nLogin to the Management Domain vCenter Server. Open a remote or web console to the first NSX Manager node of the cluster. Login using the root account and the original password. You will be prompted to change the password immediately, follow the on-screen prompts to change the root password. Now your authenticated we can disable password expiry for each account using the following sudo commands (pay careful attention to the syntax): 1su admin \u0026#39;-c clear user admin password-expiration\u0026#39; 1su admin \u0026#39;-c clear user audit password-expiration\u0026#39; 1su admin \u0026#39;-c clear user root password-expiration\u0026#39; Now the accounts are set to no longer expire, we reset the root account back to the original password also using a sudo command: 1su admin \u0026#39;-c set user root password VMw@re1!VMw@re1! old-password VMware123!VMware123!\u0026#39; All accounts should be available for connection using the original passwords. Resolving Expired Passwords for NSX Edge Nodes The second step in the process is to unlock the NSX Edge Nodes, for this process now we have the admin account of the NSX Manager working again we can use the NSX REST APIs to simplify the process. In this procedure we use a number of PowerShell cmdlets that have been included in PowerValidatedSolutions, you could simply use the APIs directly on the command line but having the APIs wrapped in PowerShell cmdlets simplifies the process for many.\nEnsure you have followed the prerequisites for installing the PowerValidatedSolutions PowerShell module and have it installed.\nStart Windows PowerShell.\nReplace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.\n1$nsxtManagerFqdn = \u0026#34;sfo-m01-nsx01.sfo.rainpole.io\u0026#34; 2$nsxtManagerUser = \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; 3$nsxtManagerPass = \u0026#34;VMw@re1!VMw@re1!\u0026#34; Perform the configuration by running the command in the PowerShell console. 1Request-NsxToken -fqdn $nsxtManagerFqdn -username $nsxtManagerUser -password $nsxtManagerPass 2$transportNodeIds = (Get-NsxtEdgeCluster).members.transport_node_id 3$userIds = @(\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10002\u0026#34;) 4foreach ($id in $transportNodeIds ) { 5 foreach ($userId in $userIds) { 6 Set-NsxtApplianceUserExpirationPolicy -userId $userId -days 0 -transportNodeId $id 7 } 8} All your NSX Edge Node accounts should also now be unblocked and set to never expire.

VMware Cloud Foundation includes the following types of bundles.\nInstall Bundles, An install bundle includes software binaries to install VI workload domains and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. Update or Upgrade Bundle, An update or upgrade bundle includes software binaries to update the appropriate VMware Cloud Foundation software components. In most cases, an upgrade bundle must be applied to the management domain before it can be applied to VI workload domains. Async Patch Bundle, An async patch bundle allows you to apply critical patches to certain VMware Cloud Foundation components (NSX-T Manager, vCenter Server, and ESXi) when an update or upgrade bundle is not available. See Async Patch Tool. This process can be a little overwhelming if you are new to VMware Cloud Foundation due to the nature in which the bundles are displayed under the Bundle Management section of the SDDC Manager UI. One of my biggest gripes here is there is no way to filter the bundles based on VMware Cloud Foundation version, product or even date. This coupled with the way they are actually displayed in the UI from a layout perspective, a table list would be easier to consume in my opinion. When you start the process of walking through the upgrade process itself, the SDDC Manager UI is actually very good at leading you down the What's Next path as you can actually only upgrade components in a particular order and this is illustrated when you select Available Updates from within a Workload Domain. If you have not pre-downloaded all the required bundles you then waste time within your change window completing this task before you can continue and so are back to needing to traverse the overwhelming Bundle Management section of the SDDC Manager UI again.\nIts for this reason that I decided to put together a very simple PowerShell script that utilizes PowerVCF to automate the process of downloading all of the bundles required for a particular release.\nUsing a JSON file, you first populate it with the bundle IDs of each bundle required. This can be done by reviewing the details of each bundle in the Bundle Management section of the SDDC Manager UI for the release you wish to prepare for. Here is a sample for VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.1.0. You can also download it from GitHub.\n1{ 2 \u0026#34;bundles\u0026#34;: [ 3 { 4 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;13d87a53-298d-4ee5-98ca-b9e10eece7a5\u0026#34;, 5 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SDDC_MANAGER\u0026#34; 6 }, 7 { 8 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8c178f33-b28d-47d0-88da-aa94f309a042\u0026#34;, 9 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SDDC_MANAGER_CONFIG_DRIFT\u0026#34; 10 }, 11 { 12 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;05be2afd-990d-45bd-9472-fab032e8c696\u0026#34;, 13 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;VCENTER_SERVER_UPGRADE\u0026#34; 14 }, 15 { 16 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;043e2b99-b36f-45b9-a4a2-1632a24764ef\u0026#34;, 17 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ESXI_UPGRADE\u0026#34; 18 }, 19 { 20 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;193486eb-53f5-40c7-8012-b5dcab515ebf\u0026#34;, 21 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NSXT_UPGRADE\u0026#34; 22 }, 23 { 24 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;05be2afd-990d-45bd-9472-fab032e8c696\u0026#34;, 25 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;VCENTER_SERVER\u0026#34; 26 }, 27 { 28 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3c32c5d6-b5e0-49c6-9a86-90bcd3de671e\u0026#34;, 29 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NSXT_INSTALL\u0026#34; 30 } 31 ] 32} Next we simply execute the vcfBundleDownload.ps1 script passing in the JSON file. The script reads the JSON, then loops through each entry first checking if the bundle has been downloaded and if not requests a download. It then monitors the download until complete before moving onto the next bundle item. You can execute the the script over and over in case a download fails and you need to re-run safe in the knowledge that it will only download missing bundles.\n1.\\vcfBundleDownload.ps1 -json .\\vcfBundleDownloadList.json Download the script from GitHub.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-bundle-download/","section":"post","tags":["API","VCF","PowerShell"],"title":"Automating the Download of VCF Bundles for a Release"},{"body":"Last Updated: 31-May-2022\nWelcome to Edition #8 of the What's New for VMware Validated Solutions, today we are announcing the following updates:\nAdded support for VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.1 Added automation based on the PowerValidatedSolutions v1.7.0 release Release of PowerValidatedSolutions v1.7.0, our PowerShell module developed to ensure robustness, consistency, and accelerate implementation Added Support for VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.1 Delighted to announce support for VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.1.\nIdentity and Access Management for VMware Cloud Foundation Developer Ready Infrastructure for VMware Cloud Foundation Intelligent Logging and Analytics for VMware Cloud Foundation Intelligent Operations Management for VMware Cloud Foundation Private Cloud Automation for VMware Cloud Foundation Site Protection and Disaster Recovery for VMware Cloud Foundation Site Protection and Disaster Recovery for VMware Cloud Foundation Updates Implementation Additional PowerValidatedSolutions Automation\nAdd a Network Adapter and Configure Static Routes for vSphere Replication (Set-vSRNetworkConfig) Create a VMkernel Adapter on the ESXi Hosts for vSphere Replication Traffic (New-vSRVMkernelPort) Configure ESXi Host Static Routes for vSphere Replication (New-vSREsxiStaticRoute) Assign Licenses to Site Recovery Manager (Set-SRMLicenseConfig) General Availability of PowerValidatedSolutions v1.7.0 Release of PowerValidatedSolutions v1.7.0, which is a PowerShell module that we have developed to not only accelerate the implementation of Validated Solutions, but ensure consistency and robustness.

Each Validated Solution provides both UI and Infrastructure-as-code based procedures. The Infrastructure-as-code method is delivered through the use of a PowerShell module specifically created to support Validated Solutions called PowerValidatedSolutions, each UI based procedure has a PowerShell cmdlet equivalent that not only performs the operation but ensures pre and post validation checks are performed to provide robustness.\nIncluded with the PowerValidatedSolution PowerShell module which can be installed directly from the Microsoft PS Gallery there is a SampleScripts folder and contained within that a folder named iam which contains sample .ps1 script files. These sample scripts demonstrate linking multiple procedures into a single executable script using the Planning and Preparation Workbook as the input for all data.\nFor the Identity and Access Management solution this is broken down into three phases and therefore three scripts as follows:\nvSphere and SDDC Manager Workspace ONE Access NSX-T Data Center As already mentioned the scripts use the Planning and Preparation Workbook to obtain all the required inputs, this is the first step in the execution. The script checks that the path provided to the workbook is valid and then opens the workbook, reading the required information using named cells.\nOnce that step is complete it begins the process of executing each procedure based on the order of steps defined within the implementation guide.\nIn addition to providing the main cmdlets supporting the validated solution implementation procedures a number of cmdlets are included that provide supporting capabilities which are utilised by the scripts.\nStart-SetupLogFile - this cmdlet is used to configure a log file where the output of each step is logged. Write-LogMessage - this cmdlet is used to format the output of messages both to the console and log file. Debug-CatchWriter - this cmdlet is used to provide a consistent way of displaying exception errors should they occur. For each procedure executed by the script, the output is captured into variables and then redirected to the Write-LogMessage cmdlet for display to the console and log in a consistent way. There are three types of output messages :\nINFO - Used for informational messages and successful execution of a procedure. WARNING - Used when a procedure is skipped due to the process already being executed. ERROR - Used to display a failure along with the failure reason. Let’s now take a deeper look at the scripts.\nvSphere and SDDC Manager (iamConfigureVsphere.ps1) The iamConfigureVsphere.ps1 script automates all the procedures associated with ESXi, vCenter Server and SDDC Manager. This includes:\nAdd Identity Provider to vCenter Server. This adds Active Directory over LDAP or LDAPS to vCenter Server making Active Directory users and groups available to both vCenter Server and SDDC Manager for assigning access control. Assign Global Permissions. This assigns the vCenter Server Administrator and Read Only roles to corresponding groups in Active Directory. Assign Single Sign-On Permissions. This assigns the Single Sign-On Administrator role to a corresponding group in Active Directory. Configure vCenter Server Appliance password expiration policy. Configure Single Sign-On password and lockout polices. Assign SDDC Manager Roles. This assigns the Admin, Operator and Viewer roles to corresponding groups in Active Directory. Configure ESXi password and lockout polices. Execution of the iamConfigureVsphere.ps1 script is performed by using the following command:\n1.\\SampleScripts\\iam\\iamConfigureVsphere.ps1 -sddcManagerFqdn sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io -sddcManagerUser administrator@vsphere.local -sddcManagerPass VMw@re1! -workbook F:\\vvs\\PnP.xlsx -filePath F:\\vvs Workspace ONE Access (iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1) The iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1 script automates the deployment and configuration of Workspace ONE Access. This includes:\nCreating a Virtual Machine folder in vCenter Server. Deploying the Workspace ONE Access .ova. Performing the configuration of Workspace ONE Access: Initial configuration. This assigns the root, admin and sshuser credentials. Configure NTP settings. Configure SMTP server settings. Install a signed-certificate. Configure password policy. Add Identity Provider to Workspace ONE Access. This adds Active Directory over LDAP or LDAPS to Workspace ONE Access making Active Directory users and groups available. Assign Workspace ONE Access Permissions. This assigns the Super Admin, Directory Admin and Read Only Admin to corresponding groups in Active Directory. Create VM Group. This creates a VM Group in vCenter Server and assigns the Workspace ONE Access virtual machine to it. Execution of the iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1 script is performed by using the following command:\n1.\\SampleScripts\\iam\\iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1 -sddcManagerFqdn sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io -sddcManagerUser administrator@vsphere.local -sddcManagerPass VMw@re1! -workbook F:\\vvs\\PnP.xlsx -filePath F:\\vvs NSX-T Data Center (iamConfigureNsx.ps1) The iamConfigureNsx.ps1 script automates the integration between the NSX Managers and Workspace ONE Access. Whilst it is possible to configure NSX-T Data Center with a direct connection to Active Directory over LDAP, the Identity and Access Management solution uses Workspace ONE Access which provides additional methods for connecting to authentication sources. This includes:\nEnable Integration between NSX Manager and Workspace ONE Access. Assign NSX-T Data Center Permissions. This assigns Enterprise Admin, Network Engineer and Auditor roles to corresponding groups in Active Directory for both the Management and Workload Domains. Configure Authentication Policies. This configure the authentication policies on the NSX Manager and NSX Edge Nodes for both the Management and Workload Domains. Create a custom role in vCenter Server. Assign Single Sign-On Permissions. This assigns the License Administration role to the NSX Manager service account used by SDDC Manager. Reduce vCenter Server Permissions. This reduces the permissions a specific vCenter Server service account has for other vCenter Servers within the Single Sign-On domain. Execution of the iamConfigureNsx.ps1 script is performed by using the following command:\n1.\\SampleScripts\\iam\\iamConfigureNsx.ps1 -sddcManagerFqdn sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io -sddcManagerUser administrator@vsphere.local -sddcManagerPass VMw@re1! -workbook F:\\vvs\\PnP.xlsx -filePath F:\\vvs After execution of these scripts in the order described above, and assuming that each step completed successfully your environment is fully configured based on the design and implementation procedures documented within the Identity and Access Management for VMware Cloud Foundation Validated Solution.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-end-to-end-iam/","section":"post","tags":["API","PowerShell","VVS","IAM"],"title":"End-to-End Automation of Identity and Access Management Validated Solution"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/iam/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IAM"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/series/powervalidatedsolutions/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"PowerValidatedSolutions"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/series/vvs-tip/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"VVS-Tip"},{"body":"Are you using the PowerValidatedSolutions PowerShell module?

For production environments its critical that this is changed before going live to ensure that you have the ability to recover in the event of a disaster.\nThe requirements of using an SFTP in my experience seem to fall through the gaps during most initial deployments and as a result it takes organizations some time to get all the requirements put in place. Such delays simply place a risk on the implementation until addressed.\nOne way to reduce this risk, and of course for use in a lab environment is to use VMware Cloud Builder as an alternative short term solution as it too has an SFTP service running, this can be achieved through a simple three step process:\nCreate a Backup Service Account on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance Create a Backup Folder on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance Re-Configure the Backup in SDDC Manager Create a Backup Service Account on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance First step is to create a local account on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance, this will be used as the service account and is supplied when re-configuring the backup configuration in SDDC Manager.\nConnect to the SDDC Manager Appliance using an SSH client such as Putty, and authenticate as admin.\nSwitch to root by entering the following command:\n1su Create the service account by entering the following command: 1useradd -m -p $(openssl passwd -1 VMw@re1!) svc-vcf-bck Create a Backup Folder on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance The next step is to create a target backup folder on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance and assign the appropriate access to allow the service account to store backup jobs.\nCreate a new folder by entering the following command: 1mkdir /tmp/vcf-backups Configure access to the folder for the service account by entering the following command: 1chown svc-vcf-bck:users /tmp/vcf-backups Re-Configure the Backup in SDDC Manager And finally you re-configure the backup configuration to use the new SFTP target for backups, performing this task will trigger SDDC Manager to automatically reconfigure SDDC Manager and NSX-T Data Center.\nLogin to the SDDC Manager UI with a user assigned with the ADMIN role.\nUsing the navigation paine, select Administration \u0026gt; Backup.\nOn the Backup paine, select Site Settings and click Register External. Enter the values, and click Save.\nSetting Value Host FQDN or IP sfo-cb01.sfo.rainpole.io Port 22 Transfer Protocol SFTP Username svc-vcf-bck Password VMw@re1! Backup Directory /tmp/vcf-backups Confirm Fingerprint Selected Encryption Passphares VMw@re1!VMw@re1! On the Confirm your changes to backup settings dialog, click Confirm. Your details will be saved and the Configure Backup of VCF Components (SDDC Manager and NSX Managers) task will start.

It's primary goal is to bootstrap the deployment and configuration of the Management Domain which includes ESXi, vCenter Server, NSX-T Data Center and SDDC Manager.\nVMware Cloud Builder was first released to support the automated deployment of the VMware Validated Design 5.0 and as part of that development work the team started with a virtual appliance known as Cloud VM which was used by Service Providers to deploy a different version of VMware Cloud Foundation back in the 2.x days. There were two challenges that the team had to overcome with the Cloud VM and they were no User Interface for easy use as it was an API only driven tool and more importantly there was no validation capabilities.\nAs part of this validation development work I had the pleasure of leading a very small team which produced a Python based utility called PlatformAudit. It's purpose was to expose the ability to perform any validation requirements we could define in a modular way. When VMware Cloud Foundation 3.0 was released it too started to consume the VMware Cloud Builder virtual appliance and naturally we extended the capabilities of PlatformAudit to handle both VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware Cloud Foundation on VxRail.\nAs VMware Cloud Foundation has evolved in terms of features naturally the validation requirements evolved too but rather than add new validation tasks into the Python modules we took a decision some time ago to build any new validation directly into the Bring-up service. This decision was made for a number of reasons but the main driver was the ability to consolidate the tasks into a single framework and code-base that could then be consumed by both VMware Cloud Builder during bring-up but more importantly by SDDC Manager for day N workflows.\nAs you can imagine these types of changes don't happen over night so the team had to combine both methods for a period of time whilst they worked on the migration of all the existing Python based validation tasks. Frankly the team did a fantastic job of this, those reading this post that are already familiar with VMware Cloud Builder were probably not even aware this ongoing transition was happening.\nThe release of VMware Cloud Foundation v4.2 sees this transitional work conclude, and not only do we now have all validation tasks being completed by the Bring-up service directly we also now have the ability to trigger validations on an individual basis (via the API only) something which was a number one requirement for the Python modules when I started on the journey with the team back then. The ability to execute single modules helps with early validation of some areas and accelerates troubleshooting on specific failures as running all validations steps each time takes some time.\nPlatformAudit is still present within VMware Cloud Builder for now but officially it has been deprecated, none of the new validation tasks exist within it and it will be removed in a future release.\nTriggering Individual Validations Let's now take a look at how you trigger individual validations, as mentioned already this is possible only by using the API right now and this can be achieved either directly from the console of VMware Cloud Builder using a curl command or by using PowerVCF a PowerShell Module that has been written to support all VMware Cloud Foundation Public APIs.\nFor both methods \u0026lt;PATH_TO_JSON_SPEC\u0026gt; is the path to the VMware Cloud Builder JSON spec to be used and \u0026lt;VALIDATION_NAME\u0026gt; is the name of the validation module you want to execute.\nUsing CURL the format of the command is:\n1curl -d @\u0026lt;PATH_TO_JSON_SPEC\u0026gt; -X POST -H \u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34; http://localhost:9080/bringup-app/v1/sddcs/validations?\u0026lt;VALIDATION_NAME\u0026gt; Using PowerVCF (v2.1.1 or later) the format of the command is:\u0026lt;\n1Start-CloudBuilderSDDCValidation -json \u0026lt;PATH_TO_JSON_SPEC\u0026gt; -validation \u0026lt;VALIDATION_NAME\u0026gt; Validation Modules We now have two methods that we can use to perform individual validations but what validation options do we have, use the following table to identity the validation module you want to execute (I'm planning a separate post with more details on what each validation module actually does in the near future):\nValidation Name for API Validation Name in the UI SECURE_PLATFORM_AUDIT Preparing Security Requirements for Running Validation JSON_SPEC_VALIDATION JSON Spec validation CLOUDBUILDER_READY_VALIDATION Cloud Builder Configuration Validation LICENSE_KEY_VALIDATION License Key Validation PASSWORDS_VALIDATION Password Validation NETWORK_IP_POOLS_VALIDATION Network IP Pool Validation HOST_IP_DNS_VALIDATION DNS Resolution Validation TIME_SYNC_VALIDATION Time Synchronization Validation NETWORK_CONFIG_VALIDATION Network Configuration Validation MANAGEMENT_NETWORKS_VALIDATION vMotion Network Connectivity Validation\nvSAN Network Connectivity Validation ESXI_VERSION_VALIDATION ESXi Version Validation ESXI_HOST_READINESS_VALIDATION ESXi Host Configuration Validation VSAN_AVAILABILITY_VALIDATION vSAN Disk Availability Validation NSXT_NETWORKS_VALIDATION NSX-T Data Center Host Overlay Network Connectivity Validation AVN_NETWORKS_VALIDATION NSX-T Data Center Edge Overlay Network Connectivity Validation\nNSX-T Data Center Uplink 1 Network Connectivity Validation\nNSX-T Data Center Uplink 2 Network Connectivity Validation\nNSX-T Data Center Host Overlay to Edge Overlay Network Connectivity Validation ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-cb-validation/","section":"post","tags":["VCF"],"title":"VMware Cloud Builder - Bringup Validation for VMware Cloud Foundation"},{"body":" I'm pleased to announce the general availability of PowerVCF v2.1.2 for download from the PowerShell Library.

This means all ESXi hosts have a common name in their self-signed certificate of localhost.localdomain. All communication between VMware Cloud Builder and the ESXi hosts is performed securely over HTTPS and as a result it validates the identify when making a connection by comparing the common name of the certificate against the FQDN provided within the VMware Cloud Builder configuration file.\nTo ensure that the connection attempts and validation does not fail, you must manually regenerate the self-signed certificate after hostname has been configured.\nRegenerate the Self-Signed Certificate on All Hosts Log in to the ESXi host using an SSH client such as Putty.\nRegenerate the self-signed certificate by executing the following command:\n1/sbin/generate-certificates Restart the hostd and vpxa services by executing the following command: 1/etc/init.d/hostd restart \u0026amp;\u0026amp; /etc/init.d/vpxa restart Repeat this procedure for all remaining hosts.

A key part of this has involved using the cmdlets within PowerVCF, but one of the challenges we face is that a lot of the VMware Cloud Foundation APIs require a JSON spec to be passed as part of the API call.\nThis means that for each of our physical test beds we have to maintain separate JSON spec files, and some of the JSON specs additionally require unique IDs that have to be obtained from the fresh deployment of VMware Cloud Foundation.\nAnother disadvantage is that each time we deploy to save on the effort around maintaining these JSON specs the team rely on using the same naming conventions over and over.\nThis got me thinking that there must be a better way where we could maintain a single source of input dedicated to each physical environment and remove those silly keying mistakes at the same time.\nWith VMware Cloud Foundation v4.0 / VMware Validated Design v6.0 we introduced a new approach around the Planning and Preparation content where we replaced static web content with an Excel Workbook known as the Planning and Preparation Workbook, the idea behind the Workbook is that it can now be used as a tool for capturing all the input data needed to be successful when deploying either just VMware Cloud Foundation or extending it further with the VMware Validated Design capabilities. For a more detailed explanation check out my friend and colleague Ken Gould's blog on the topic VMware Validated Design 6.0 / VMware Cloud Foundation 4.0 Planning \u0026amp; Preparation.\nAs this pretty much contains everything we need except for passwords I decided to look at ways of generating the JSON specs directly from it.\nIn the interests of sharing with the wider community, I thought I would write a series of blog posts on the topic and share my code snippets in the hope it may help or inspire others. I hope you find the information useful.\nHere are a list of the topics covered:\nAutomating VCF - Deploy Management Domain Automating VCF - Create Network Pool Automating VCF - Commission Hosts Automating VCF - Deploy Workload Domain Automating VCF - Deploy NSX-T Edge Cluster Automating VCF - Deploy vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2020/powervcf-automation/","section":"archive","tags":["API","PowerShell","VCF"],"title":"Automating VMware Cloud Foundation with APIs/PowerVCF/PowerShell"},{"body":" In this part three of this blog series, I'm going to take a look at how you perform the restore of SDDC Manager using PowerVCF v2.0.\nPrerequisites\nIn order to perform the restore process you will need the following information:\nBackup file name and location of the backup file.Encryption passphrase used to encrypt the backup file (this is the password you set when configuring the external backup target). Performing a Restore of SDDC Manager Procedure\n1. First power off the original SDDC Manager virtual appliance and rename the virtual machine in vCenter Server to something like sfo-vcf01-original.\n2. In order to restore SDDC Manager you have to deploy a clean OVA, see 2.14.5. Initiate Restore of SDDC Manager for details on how to obtain the correct OVA file. Then deploy a new SDDC Manager virtual appliance to the vCenter Server. I'm using the OVF Tool for speed, here is the syntax, copy and paste into a command window:\n\"C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\VMware OVF Tool\\ovftool.exe\" --noSSLVerify --skipManifestCheck --powerOn --diskMode=thin --acceptAllEulas --allowExtraConfig --ipProtocol=IPv4 --ipAllocationPolicy=fixedPolicy --prop:ROOT_PASSWORD=\"VMw@re1!\" --prop:VCF_PASSWORD=\"VMw@re1!\" --prop:BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=\"VMw@re1!\" --prop:BACKUP_PASSWORD=\"VMw@re1!\" --prop:vami.hostname=\"sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io\" --prop:guestinfo.ntp=\"ntp.sfo.rainpole.io\" --prop:vami.gateway.SDDC-Manager=\"172.28.211.1\" --prop:vami.domain.SDDC-Manager=\"sfo.rainpole.io\" --prop:vami.searchpath.SDDC-Manager=\"sfo.rainpole.io,rainpole.io\" --prop:vami.DNS.SDDC-Manager=\"172.28.211.4,172.28.211.5\" --prop:vami.ip0.SDDC-Manager=\"172.28.211.59\" --prop:vami.netmask0.SDDC-Manager=\"255.255.255.0\" --datastore=\"sfo-m01-cl01-ds-vsan01\" --name=\"sfo-vcf01\" --network=\"sfo-m01-cl01-vds01-pg-mgmt\" --X:injectOvfEnv --X:waitForIp E:\\VCF-SDDC-Manager-Appliance-4.0.0.0-15956695_OVF10.ova \"vi://administrator@vsphere.local:VMw@re1!@sfo-m01-vc01.sfo.rainpole.io/sfo-m01-dc01/host/sfo-m01-cl01//Resources/sfo-m01-cl01-rp-sddc-mgmt\" 3. Verify that the new SDDC Manager appliance has been deployed correctly, ssh in to the VM as the vcf user.\n4. Take a snapshot of the new SDDC Manager virtual appliance.\n5. Transfer into the new SDDC Manager the encrypted backup file to the /tmp directory. Because I'm using VMware Cloud Builder as my external backup target I can transfer directly into the new SDDC Manager virtual appliance.

Open a PowerShell console and connect to SDDC Manager using the PowerVCF cmdlet Connect-VCFManager. Enter the following command:\nConnect-VCFManager sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io admin VMw@re1! -basicAuth 7. Trigger a restore using the PowerVCF cmdlet Start-VCFRestore.

Why use PowerVCF you might be asking well the simple answer is that in order to perform the backup and restore procedures of SDDC Manager you have to use the Public APIs for VMware Cloud Foundation. From a VMware Cloud Foundation documentation perspective the relevant information can be found at the following locations:\nOperations and Administration Guide - Backing Up and Restoring SDDC Manager and NSX ManagerAPI Documentation - Backup and Restore Configuring a Backup Target for SDDC Manager Part one of this blog series will take a look at configuring SDDC Manager with an external backup target.\nBy default following a successful deployment of VMware Cloud Foundation, SDDC Manager is configured to backup to itself, and when you log into the administration user interface a banner message is displayed stating that you should reconfigure. For the purpose of testing I use my VMware Cloud Builder appliance as this is enabled with an SFTP service but before performing the reconfiguration of SDDC Manager I need to perform some additional steps on the VMware Cloud Builder appliance itself.\nProcedure\n1. Connect to the VMware Cloud Builder appliance using and SSH client such as Putty and log in using the admin user.\n2. Create a new local service account called svc-vcf-bck. Enter the following command:\nsudo useradd -m -p $(openssl passwd -1 'VMw@re1!') svc-vcf-bck NOTE: There is a requirement in VMware Cloud Foundation 4.0 where you must have a home directory, this is becuase when the backup API is run it checks for the existence, this is something that will be addressed in the next release. 3. Sudo as the new service account and create the target folder for backups. Enter the following commands:\nsudo su - svc-vcf-bck\nmkdir /tmp/backups 4. Create the JSON spec for configuring an external backup target in SDDC Manager. To obtain the sshFingerprint run the following command on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance and copy / paste into the JSON spec:\nssh-keygen -lf \u0026lt;(ssh-keyscan -t ssh-rsa -p 22 172.28.211.60 2\u0026gt;/dev/null) { \"backupLocations\": [ { \"directoryPath\": \"/tmp/backups/\", \"password\": \"VMw@re1!\", \"port\": 22, \"protocol\": \"SFTP\", \"server\": \"172.28.211.60\", \"sshFingerprint\": \"SHA256:sptZq0mdjboC9AT8hZ8sz16c1JWIQxaFof/T407RnQg\", \"username\": \"svc-vcf-bck\" } ], \"encryption\": { \"passphrase\": \"VMw@re1!VMw@re1!\" } } 5. Open a PowerShell console and connect to SDDC Manager using the PowerVCF cmdlet Connect-VCFManager. Enter the following command:\nConnect-VCFManager sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io administrator@vsphere.local VMw@re1! 6. Configure SDDC Manager with the external backup target using the PowerVCF cmdlet Set-VCFBackupConfiguration. Enter the following command:\nSet-VCFBackupConfiguration -json E:\\MyLab\\backupConfiguration.json 7. Check the status of the task by using the PowerVCF cmdlet Get-VCFTask. Enter the following command:\nGet-VCFTask -id 60f7fc20-ab69-4e51-8730-57258f9af7d7 8. Check the configuration using the PowerVCF cmdlet Get-VCFBackupConfiguration. Enter the following command:\nGet-VCFBackupConfiguration There you have it that completes the steps for configuring SDDC Manager to use an external backup source. In my next post I will walk through the process of performing the backup.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2020/powervcf-backup-restore-01/","section":"archive","tags":["API","PowerShell","VCF","Backup","Restore"],"title":"PowerVCF v2.0 - Backup and Restore of SDDC Manager - Configuration (Part 1)"},{"body":" For those that follow my blog posts you will be aware that I’m involved with the development of PowerVCF a collection of PowerShell cmdlets created to expose the Public APIs of VMware Cloud Foundation. Whilst working on PowerVCF v2.0 I started to take a look at the Public APIs for VMware Cloud Builder, I’ve been heavily involved with the development team for a number of years now and knew there were both Public and Private APIs but just never had the time to dig deeper. First thing to note is that the Public APIs for VMware Cloud Builder are actually documented within the Public APIs for VMware Cloud Foundation here. From within the documentation refer to the section named 2.3. SDDCs (Management Domain), there is support for the following API calls:\nGET /v1/sddcs - Retrieve all SDDCsPOST /v1/sddcs - Create SDDCGET /v1/sddcs/{id} - Retrieve a SDDCPATCH /v1/sddcs/{id} - Retry failed SDDC creationGET /v1/sddcs/validations - Get all SDDC specification validationsPOST /v1/sddcs/validations - Validate SDDC specification before creationGET /v1/sddcs/validations/{id} - Get SDDC specification validation status by IDDELETE /v1/sddcs/validations/{id} - Cancel SDDC specification validationPATCH /v1/sddcs/validations/{id} - Retry SDDC validation Based on these APIs, I built a number of new PowerVCF cmdlets as follows:\nGet-CloudBuilderSDDCStart-CloudBuilderSDDCRestart-CloudBuilderSDDCGet-CloudBuilderSDDCValidationStart-CloudBuilderSDDCValidationStop-CloudBuilderSDDCValidationRestart-CloudBuilderSDDCValidation Next I needed to work on building a valid JSON spec to be used both during the validation and deployment phases, sounds like a simple task based on the fact that VMware Cloud Builder already takes the Deployment Parameters Workbook and converts it into a JSON file through the utility called JsonGenerator however not quite so. The biggest challenge here is that in VMware Cloud Foundation 4.0 the User Interface still uses the Private APIs which means there are a number of differences between the JSON elements used for the Private API versus the Public API so just taking and reusing the JSON file was not possible. A couple of examples include:\n\"VLANId\" versus \"vlanId\"\"dvsId\" versus \"dvsName\"\"niocSpec\" versus \"niocSpecs\" After walking through and doing a comparison section by section I finally had what I hoped to be a working JSON and was ready to perform end to end testing using the new PowerVCF cmdlets and the JSON spec. For the working JSON sample, see the bottom of this post.\nI will now cover the process of using the new PowerVCF cmdlets to drive the deployment of a VMware Cloud Foundation 4.0 Management Domain.\nAssumption: You have already installed or imported PowerVCF on your system.\nPerforming Validations using PowerVCF v2.0 The following procedure demonstrates the process of using PowerVCF to perform the validation of the JSON spec and target environment using VMware Cloud Builder.\nProcedure\n1. Before performing any operations on VMware Cloud Builder using PowerVCF you must enter the credentials, the PowerVCF cmdlet Connect-CloudBuilder takes these credentials and stores them as a base64 string which is then used for each subsequent cmdlet. Enter the following syntax.\nConnect-CloudBuilder -fqdn sfo-cb01.sfo.rainpole.io -username admin -password VMw@re1! 2. Taking a copy of the sample JSON file from the bottom of this post, copy and paste into an editor (I use Notepad++), make changes as they correspond to your environment and save the file. I'm using sfo-managementDomain.json for the purpose of this blog post and saving it to the root of my E: Drive.\n3. Next we want trigger the validation process, this is achieved using the Start-CloudBuilderSDDCValidation cmdlet and passing it the json file we created in the previous step. Enter the following syntax.\nStart-CloudBuilderSDDCValidation -json E:\\sfo-managementDomain.json Here we can see the output of the Start-CloudBuilderSDDCValidation cmdlet, the task has a unique ID which can be used with the Get-CloudBuilderSDDCValidation cmdlet to get updates on the validation process.\nWe can also log into the VMware Cloud Builder user interface where we also see the validation workflow in progress.\n4. Now using the Get-CloudBuilderSDDCValidation cmdlet and the unique ID shown during the triggering of the validation workflow we can check the status using the following syntax.\nGet-CloudBuilderSDDCValidation -id 9f13aac9-3d9c-43f1-b41a-d152d418b4b6 We can see based on the executionStatus the validation has COMPLETED, we can verify this further through the VMware Cloud Builder user interface.\nWhen looking at status of the validation using the VMware Cloud Builder user interface you will see that there are a number of validations performed, each with their own status. 5. We can view the same level of detail using the PowerVCF cmdlet by simply adding ConvertTo-Json to the command as follows:\nGet-CloudBuilderSDDCValidation -id 9f13aac9-3d9c-43f1-b41a-d152d418b4b6 | ConvertTo-Json Once your audit has finished and has the COMPLETED status we can move on to trigger the actual deployment.\nPerforming Deployment using PowerVCF 2.0 Now we have the json spec and the infrastructure validated we are ready trigger the actual deployment.\nProcedure\n1. Using the PowerVCF cmdlet Connect-CloudBuilder connect to the VMware Cloud Builder appliance using the following syntax.\nConnect-CloudBuilder -fqdn sfo-cb01.sfo.rainpole.io -username admin -password VMw@re1! 2. Using the Start-CloudBuilderSDDC cmdlet and passing it the json file we start the deployment workflow using the following syntax.\nStart-CloudBuilderSDDC -json E:\\sfo-managementDomain.json Here we can see the output of the Start-CloudBuilderSDDC cmdlet, the task has a unique ID which can be used with the Get-CloudBuilderSDDC cmdlet to get updates on the validation process.\nAnd again we can see the status of the deployment by logging into the VMware Cloud Builder user interface.\n3. Now using the Get-CloudBuilderSDDC cmdlet and the unique ID shown during the trigger of the workflow we can check the status using the following syntax.\nGet-CloudBuilderSDDC -id d5b175e1-a966-4845-85c3-43e98e616267 After some time, we can see based on the status the deployment has COMPLETED_WITH_SUCCESS, we can verify this further through the VMware Cloud Builder user interface.\nAnd there you have it, using the new VMware Cloud Builder cmdlets released with PowerVCF 2.0 it's now possible to script the automation of the validation and deployment of a VMware Cloud Foundation 4.0 Management Domain.\nHope you have found this post useful, if you have comments then please feel free to get in touch.\nSample JSON File { \"excludedComponents\": [ \"NSX-V\" ],

Greenfield Deployments Only The first thing to note is that this release is only for greenfield deployments and does not include an upgrade process from previous versions of the VMware Validated Design at this current time. There are a number of reasons for this but read on to find out more.\nBill of Materials One of the most significant changes relates to the Bill of Materials (BoM) and this centers around, vSphere 7.0, NSX-T Data Center 3.0, vRealize Suite 8.1, Workspace ONE Access 3.3, and the most significant change the inclusion of VMware Cloud Foundation 4.0 at the heart of the solution.\nPlanning and Preparation Workbook Starting with this release the static Planning and Preparation document has been ported over into an Excel Workbook, this has been done to enable customers to use it as more of a tool allowing customer inputs along side the VMware Validated Design examples to aid with the deployment process. The workbook is also shared between VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware Validated Design.\nvSphere 7.0 Design From an vSphere 7.0 architecture perspective the biggest change is the deprecation of external Platform Services Controllers in vCenter Server and as a result all vCenter Servers now use an embedded Platform Services Controller which also means there is no longer a requirement for an NSX based Load Balancer.\nvSAN 7.0 Design The design changes for VSAN include All-Flash by default and a minimum of two disk groups in line with VMware best practices.\nNSX-T Data Center 3.0 Design NSX-V has been completely removed, both the Management Domain and Workload Domains now use NSX-T Data Center for all Software-Defined Networking capabilities.\nvRealize Suite 8.1 The design to the vRealize Suite includes vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, vRealize Operations Manager, vRealize Log Insight, and vRealize Automation.\nThe biggest change here is in relation to vRealize Automation where the Windows based DEMs, Orchestrators, and Agents are gone so is the requirement for a Microsoft SQL Server.\nThere are minimal changes for vRealize Operations Manager and vRealize Log Insight but a point of note is that vRealize Business for Cloud is no longer a part of the solution.\nWorkspace ONE Access 3.3 New to the VMware Validated Design we have included Workspace ONE Access to provide a single entry point for authentication from an external provider such as Active Directory. Workspace ONE Access is also used to deliver Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for NSX-T Data Center specifically as without there is no way to provide such controls.\nVMware Cloud Foundation 4.0 Whilst I’ve not mentioned anything about VMware Cloud Foundation 4.0 until now this is probably the most significant change to the VMware Validation Design. From this release forward the design will include VMware Cloud Foundation at the heart, which means that all architecture design elements between what VMware Cloud Foundation implements are 100% aligned with the VMware Validated Design. In a nutshell this means where VMware Cloud Foundation has an automated workflow the end state maps directly to the architecture design documented in the VMware Validated Design Architecture and Design documentation.\nMore importantly where VMware Cloud Foundation has no automated workflow then the VMware Validated Design will contain complimentary architecture design and deployment guidance covering the gaps\nAnything Else to be Aware of? Multi-Region - Unfortunately due to constraints in underlying products this release of the VMware Validated Design is only applicable for a single region, the plan is to add multi region support in a future release once support is available.\nModular Documentation Structure - The Architecture and Design, and Deployment Guides are broken up into modular components covering Management Domain, Workload Domain and Cloud Operations and Automation Solution which should make it easier to consume.\nUseful Links VMware Validated Design Documentation VMware Validated Design 6.0 Release Notes Planning and Preparation Workbook ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2020/vvd-whats-new-600/","section":"archive","tags":["VVD"],"title":"VMware Validated Design 6.0 - What’s New"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/vvd/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"VVD"},{"body":" If you follow my posts you will know that in January I posted about the release of PowerVCF which is a PowerShell based CLI that exposes the public APIs of VMware Cloud Foundation to be easily consumed by VI Admins (see Introducing PowerVCF – Power to VI Admins).\nAs mentioned before PowerVCF is a open source project and the team has been working hard in their spare time to continue to evolve the cmdlets it offers.

For those that don't know in the current release in order to integrate SDDC Manager with your Microsoft Certificate Authority you have to enable basic authentication (see PowerVCF – Configure the Microsoft Certificate Authority for VMware Cloud Foundation Integration (Part 1) on reviewing the official documentation I found nothing to explain the minimum requirements as is it related to least privilege access so I set about trying to figure it out.\nWhat I found is that it is indeed possible but it has to be done in two specific locations as follows:\nConfigure Microsoft Certificate Authority Server Configure Microsoft Certificate Authority Template Let's now take a look at what you need to do. In this example I'm using a dedicated service account called svc-mgr-ca which is just a Domain User.\nConfigure Microsoft Certificate Authority Server Log in to the Microsoft Certificate Authority server by using a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client.Configure least privilege access for svc-mgr-ca on the Microsoft Certificate Authority.Click Start \u0026gt; Run, enter certsrv.msc, and click OK.Right-click the certificate authority and click Properties.Click the Security tab, and click Add.Enter the svc-mgr-ca service account and click OK.In the Permissions for svc-mgr-ca section configure the following permissions and click OK. Configure Microsoft Certificate Authority Template Configure least privilege access for svc-mgr-ca on the Microsoft Certificate Authority Template.Click Start \u0026gt; Run, enter certtmpl.msc, and click OK.Right-click the VMware template and click Properties.Click the Security tab, and click Add.Enter the svc-mgr-ca service account and click OK.In the Permissions for svc-mgr-ca section configure the following permissions and click OK.

The series looks at the end to end process that you follow to take a freshly installed VMware Cloud Foundation platform (Management Domain) and replace the components with signed certificates using a Microsoft Certificate Authority.\nIn this post we will look at the process of installing the signed certificates using SDDC Manager.\nInstall Signed Certificates using the User Interface The following procedure demonstrates the process through the SDDC Manager User Interface.\nProcedure\nLog in to SDDC Manager using a web browser.Open a Web browser and go to\u0026nbsp;https://lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local.Log in using the administrator@vsphere.local user accountNavigate to Inventory \u0026gt; Workload Domains.In the Workload Domains window, under Virtual Infrastructure VI select View Details. In the Virtual Infrastructure (VI) window, select MGMT from the Domain column. Select the Security tab. Select the checkbox in the table header to select all resource types and click Install Certificates. NOTE: If you have not completed the Generate CSR and Generate Signed Certificates steps then refer to Parts 3 and Part 4 of this series.\nOnce complete the User Interface is updated with a status message of Certificate Installation is successful along with the message Added root certificate chain to the SDDC Manager keystore, you need to restart the SDDC Manager services manually (refer documentation).\nConnect to SDDC Manager lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local using an SSH client such as Putty.Log in using the vcf user account.Switch to root using the su command.Restart all the SDDC Manager services. Enter the following command and enter Y. /opt/vmware/vcf/operationsmanager/scripts/cli/sddcmanager_restart_services.sh Wait for the services to restart, then on logging back into the User Interface you will see the warning message has gone and just the Certificate Installation is successful remains.\nInstall Signed Certificates using using PowerVCF The following procedure demonstrates the process through PowerVCF.\nAssumption: You have already installed or imported PowerVCF on your system.\nProcedure\nBefore performing any operations on SDDC Manager using PowerVCF you must enter the credentials, the PowerVCF cmdlet Request-VCFToken takes these credentials and stores them as a base64 string which is then used for each subsequent cmdlet. Enter the following syntax.\nConnect-VCFManager -fqdn lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local -username admin -password \"VMw@re1!\" The process of generating the signed certificates via PowerVCF requires passing a JSON spec containing the required input details as follows:\n{ \"operationType\": \"\", \"resources\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"\", \"name\": \"\", \"resourceId\": \"\", \"type\": \"\" }] } The operationType element supports INSTALL. In our example we will now enter INSTALL as follows.\n{ \"operationType\": \"INSTALL\", \"resources\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"\", \"name\": \"\", \"resourceId\": \"\", \"type\": \"\" }] } Next we need to populate the resources part of the JSON spec for each component we want to install the certificate for. To achieve this we need the following four elements of information for each component (just like we did for generating the CSR files and creating the signed certificates):\nfqdn - The fully distinguished domain name as it relates to the information stored in the SDDC Manager inventory.name - The hostname which can be derived from the fqdnresourceId - The unique id assigned to the component and stored in the SDDC Manager inventory.type - The flag to identify what type of component the resources is, SDDC Manager has the following resource types SDDC_MANAGER, PSC, VCENTER, NSX_MANAGER, NSXT_MANAGER, VRA, VRLI, VROPS, VRSLCM, VXRAIL_MANAGER In this example we are going to include VCENTER and SDDC_MANAGER resource types, and using the Get-VCFvCenter and Get-VCFManager cmdlets we can obtain the fqdn and resourceIds details.\nFirst lets look at the Get-VCFvCenter cmdlet. Enter the following syntax:\nGet-VCFvCenter | select id,fqdn Using the select command we can return just the id and fqdn details which is all we need for the JSON spec, using this information we can now build the resource section like this:\n{ \"operationType\": \"INSTALL\", \"resources\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"lax01m01vc01.lax.rainpole.local\", \"name\": \"lax01m01vc01\", \"resourceId\": \"a0652869-dc9b-426a-a9f6-f2866830dceb\", \"type\": \"VCENTER\" } ] } Next we want to do the same for SDDC Manager using the Get-VCFManager cmdlet. Enter the following syntax:\nGet-VCFManager | select id,fqdn Add this additional information to our JSON spec file as follows, and then save the file in this example I call it updateCertificateSpec.json.\n{ \"operationType\": \"INSTALL\", \"resources\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"lax01m01vc01.lax.rainpole.local\", \"name\": \"lax01m01vc01\", \"resourceId\": \"a0652869-dc9b-426a-a9f6-f2866830dceb\", \"type\": \"VCENTER\" },{ \"fqdn\": \"lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local\", \"name\": \"lax01mgr01\", \"resourceId\": \"41290562-a6a5-4d3b-8f3c-25b0dd5535f6\", \"type\": \"SDDC_MANAGER\" } ] } Now we have our JSON spec ready we can perform the process of installing the signed certificates using the Set-VCFCertificate cmdlet. When executing this cmdlet we need to provide two inputs, first the name of the Workload Domain, in this example we are using MGMT and the json file we have just created. Enter the following syntax:\nSet-VCFCertificate -domainName MGMT -json E:\\MyLab\\updateCertificateSpec.json After executing this command you are presented with a response which relates to a Task ID and the status of the request, you can check the status of the request using the Get-VCFTask cmdlet. Enter the following syntax:\nGet-VCFTask d6c66f48-e95f-4382-8945-45ca2efc12e0 | select id,name,status Here we can see a task is named Certificate Operation: REPLACE_CERTIFICATE and it has a status of IN_PROGRESS. This step takes some time as it cycles through the components, you can issue the same Get-VCFTask command over and over until the status changes to SUCCESSFUL as follows.\nThe final step in the process is to restart the SDDC Manager services.\nConnect to SDDC Manager lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local using an SSH client such as Putty.Log in using the vcf user account.Switch to root using the su command.Restart all the SDDC Manager services. Enter the following command and enter Y. /opt/vmware/vcf/operationsmanager/scripts/cli/sddcmanager_restart_services.sh And there you have it we have successfully replaced the vCenter Server and SDDC Manager systems with CA Signed Certificates using both the User Interface and PowerVCF.\nI hope you have found this series of posts helpful.\nUseful Links If you would like to learn more about VMware Cloud Foundation or PowerVCF, check out these links:\nVMware Cloud Foundation Documentation VMware Cloud Foundation General FAQ VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9 Release Notes VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9.1 Release Notes PowerVCF Documentation PowerVCF PowerShell Library Download ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2020/powervcf-certificates-05/","section":"archive","tags":["API","PowerShell","VCF"],"title":"PowerVCF - Install Signed Certificates on Each Component Managed by SDDC Manager (Part 5)"},{"body":" This is the fourth of five blogs in the series that discusses the process of Certificate Management with VMware Cloud Foundation.

Create and Add a Microsoft Certificate Authority Template Next we need to set up a Microsoft Certificate Authority template on the Active Directory (AD) server. The template contains the certificate authority (CA) attributes for signing certificates for the SDDC components. After you create the template, you add it to the certificate templates of the Microsoft Certificate Authority.\nProcedure\nLog in to the Active Directory server by using a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client.Click Start \u0026gt; Run, enter certtmpl.msc, and click OK.In the Certificate Template Console window, under Template Display Name, right-click Web Server and select Duplicate Template.In the Duplicate Template dialog box, and click OK.In the Properties of New Template dialog box, click the General tab.In the Template display name text box, enter VMware.Click the Extensions tab and configure the following.Select Application Policies and click Edit.Select Server Authentication, click Remove, and click OK.If present, select the Client Authentication policy, click Remove, and click OK.Select Key Usage and click Edit.Select the Signature is proof of origin (nonrepudiation) check box.Leave the defaults for all other options.Click OK.Click the Subject Name tab, ensure that the Supply in the request option is selected, and click OK to save the template.Add the new template to the certificate templates of the Microsoft CA.Click Start \u0026gt; Run, enter certsrv.msc, and click OK.In the Certification Authority window, expand the left pane, right-click Certificate Templates, and select New \u0026gt; Certificate Template to Issue.In the Enable Certificate Templates dialog box, select VMware, and click OK. And there we have it, we've now configured the Microsoft Certificate Authority server with the required configuration changes to allow SDDC Manager the ability to connect and interact.\nIf you would like to learn more about VMware Cloud Foundation or PowerVCF, check out these links:\nVMware Cloud Foundation Documentation VMware Cloud Foundation General FAQ VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9 Release Notes VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9.1 Release Notes PowerVCF Documentation PowerVCF PowerShell Library Download ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2020/powervcf-certificates-01/","section":"archive","tags":["API","PowerShell","VCF"],"title":"PowerVCF - Configure the Microsoft Certificate Authority for VMware Cloud Foundation Integration (Part 1)"},{"body":" In this blog series I’m going to explore the capabilities provided in VMware Cloud Foundation that allow you to perform certificate management across components managed by SDDC Manager.\nThe capability to manage certificates was introduced a number of releases ago but with the release of version 3.9 the ability to perform these same operations were exposed via a number Public APs and now with the introduction of PowerVCF (see Introducing PowerVCF - Power to VI Admins) these operations can now be scripted using PowerShell.\nThis series of blogs will look at the end to end process that you follow to take a freshly installed VMware Cloud Foundation platform (Management Domain) and replace the components with signed certificates from a Microsoft Certificate Authority, this process is valid for other components deployed but for simplicity I’m going to focus on the Management Domain only.

With the release of VMware Cloud Builder v2.0 the biggest change is that we now support the automated deployment of both VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware Validated Designs using the same base OVA. When you deploy the OVA you pass a SKU value of vcf for VMware Cloud Foundation, vcf-vxrail for VMware Cloud Foundation on VxRail and vvd for VMware Validated Designs, depending on the value chosen the appliance on first boot will install and configured the correct user interface.\nMultiple software bundles. In this release we have broken down iso bundle from a single 24GB file into multiple files. Contained within the VMware Cloud Builder OVA itself we have the sddc-foundation-bundle.x.x.x.x-xxxxxxxx.iso file which contains the binaries for the foundation layer including ESXi, vCenter, NSX and SDDC Manager. This is used by both VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware Validated Designs. The sddc-vrealize-bundle.x.x.x.x-xxxxxxxx.iso file is downloaded separately and contains the binaries for the vRealize Suite and is used by the VMware Validated Designs workflows. The sddc-dr-bundle.x.x.x.x-xxxxxxxx.iso file is also downloaded separately and contains the binaries for Site Recovery Manager and vSphere Replication.

In this post I will provide some background history and provide a bit of detail as to exactly what VMware Cloud Builder is and how it can be used.\nHistory Nearly four years ago, the ISBU embarked on a journey to develop a blueprint architecture for implementing a Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) and thus VMware Validated Designs were born. As you can imagine the work involved to validate the blueprint required the team to repeatedly tear down and build up environments to validate operationally and develop the documentation we have come to know and love, an idea of using automation was hatched and a small team of developers set about building a tool that became known internally as VVD Deployment Toolkit (DTK). A short time after its inception whilst working for another team outside of the ISBU I convinced my now manager to release the DTK to VMware Professional Services and for around two and half years they used the DTK to implement many VMware Validated Design deployments delivering faster time-to-value for our customers. About twelve months ago we took the decision to migrate all of the automation from DTK over into the same orchestration engine that is used by VMware Cloud Foundation and with the release of VMware Validated Design v4.3 we replaced DTK with VMware Cloud Builder however this continued to be only made available for internal ISBU use and VMware Professional Services only until now….\nWhat is VMware Cloud Builder? VMware Cloud Builder is an appliance distributed as an Open Virtualization Appliance (OVA) package that manages the orchestration of deployment and configuration of an SDDC platform that adheres to the blueprint set out by VMware Validated Designs. What this means is that it’s not a general-purpose automation tool for just laying down some VMware products but rather it configures them based on the VMware Validated Design chosen. Once the appliance has been deployed you upload the VMware Validated Design Software Bundle which is a single ISO file containing all the VMware product binaries defined for that release of the VMware Validated Design, upload signed-certificates generated using CertGen (see KB 2146215) run the reconfigure.sh script to mount the ISO and perform some configuration steps and your all set. Only requirement is that you own the licenses for each component that is deployed and that you need to gather the deployment configuration using the relevant Deployment Parameters XLS file for the architecture, these can be download from my.vmware.com or directly from the VMware Cloud Builder appliance once deployed.\nThe VMware Validated Design Software Bundle contains the following VMware software binaries:\nVMware ESXi VMware vCenter Server VMware NSX for vSphere VMware vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager VMware vRealize Operations Manager Management Packs for vRealize Operations Manager VMware vRealize Log Insight Content Packs for vRealize Log Insight VMware vRealize Automation VMware vRealize Business for Cloud VMware Site Recovery Manager VMware vSphere Replication What architectures can I deploy with VMware Cloud Builder? The VMware Validated Designs support a number of different architectures that have been developed to support different customer profiles. VMware Cloud Builder has been developed to be flexible enough to handle these different architectures and today supports the following:\nVMware Validated Design for Software-Defined Data Center – Region A VMware Validated Design for Software-Defined Data Center – Region B VMware Validated Design for Management and Workload Consolidation Home Page - VMware Cloud Builder User Interface\nWhat is the Deployment Parameters XLS File? When deploying the VMware Validated Designs using VMware Cloud Builder we provide levels of flexibility in that we can configure using customer defined naming conventions for objects such as hostnames, datacenters, clusters, datastores as well as allocation of IP addresses and networks. This customer specific information is captured in the excel workbook known as the Deployment Parameters XLS file.\nThe process of gathering this custom configuration involves siting down and populating the relevant Deployment Parameters XLS file. The configuration gathering process has been developed using an excel workbook as it provides the most flexible method for data gathering due to its portability and ease of updates.\nThe Deployment Parameters XLS file consists of a number of worksheets or tabs, each defined to collect specific types of data typically aligned with the discussions you have during the data gathering process with the target audiences such as roles and responsibilities within the organization.\nThe Deployment Parameters XLS file contains the following worksheets:\nPrerequisites Checklist – contains details concerning the preparation phase of the deployment and used to track the status of the preparation work. Management Workloads – from a data gathering stand-point used to capture the license keys used by each VMware solution. Also contains a footprint breakdown of all the management component virtual machines deployed as part of the architecture for reference. Users and Groups – captures service accounts and groups in Active Directory that are required by the deployment as well as all the passwords that are used. Hosts and Networks – captures all VLAN configuration details pertaining to the environment and the configuration details for each ESXi host. Deployment Parameters – captures product specific configuration options exposed for customization including hostnames, IP address, Active Directory, DNS and NTP configuration, vCenter objects and more. vRA Configuration – captures configuration details that should be applied to a tenant that is created within vRealize Automation. Run Parameters – provides the ability to manipulate how VMware Cloud Builder implements the SDDC platform such as instructing it to not use VSAN or not deploying a specific product. CertConfig – auto populated worksheet that pulls the required details for using the CertConfig utility to automate the creation of the configuration files used by CertGen to generate the signed certificates across all VMware solutions. Microsoft Excel - Deployment Parameter Workbook How does this all come together? Now we have a better understanding of VMware Cloud Builder and the supporting files that are available for download from my.vmware.com let’s describe the end-to-end workflow. The general flow is as follows:\nPrepare the environment by performing all the prerequisites as documented in the Deployment Guides: Prepare ESXi hosts Prepare UMDS virtual machine Prepare vRealize Automation IaaS Master VM Prepare SQL Server for vRealize Automation Prepare Site Recovery Manager Generate signed certificates Populate the Deployment Parameters XLS file. Download and deploy the VMware Cloud Builder appliance Upload the software bundle Upload the signed certificates Deploy the Software-Defined Data Center Generate the JSON file Audit the deployment parameters and target environment Deploy the Software-Defined Data Center Perform manual post-deployment procedures As you can see VMware Cloud Builder drastically reduces the procedures for deploying an SDDC platform allowing you to focus more of your time on delivering business benefits.\nConclusion With the release of VMware Cloud Builder, customers have a new tool to automate the deployment of a VMware Validated Design. Using VMware Cloud Builder not only accelerates the time to value for our customers, but it also ensures consistency with the VMware Validated Design from a deployment, configuration and operational readiness perspective.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2019/cb-vvd-automation/","section":"archive","tags":["Cloud Builder","VVD"],"title":"Introducing VMware Cloud Builder, Automated Deployment of VMware Validated Designs"},{"body":"I work at VMware in the UK as a Senior Staff Solution Architect within the Cloud Infrastructure Business Group (CIBG) which is a global team responsible for the solution design for VMware Cloud Foundation, VMware Validated Solutions.

If you wanted to connect to a specific tenant and not the default tenant, then you can use the '--tenant' parameter as follows. In the examples above we used the 'vra login userpass' command, but the tool also provides the ability to use a keyfile with the 'vra login keyfile' command.

With the introduction of v5.2, VMware provided enhanced integration so that vCAC would correctly discover the relationship between the primary and recovery virtual machines.\nThese enhancements consisted of what could be considered minor modifications, albeit minor they were fundamental to ensuring that vCenter Site Recovery Manager (SRM) could successfully be implemented to the deliver disaster recovery of virtual machines managed by vCAC. So What’s Changed? When a virtual machine is protected by SRM a ‘Managed Object Reference ID’ or ‘MoRefID’ is created against the virtual machine record in the vCenter Server database.\nPrior to SRM v5.5 a single virtual machine property was created on the placeholder virtual machine object in the recovery site vCenter Server database called ‘ManagedBy:SRM,placeholderVM’, but vCAC did not inspect this value and so would attempt to add a second duplicate entry into its database, with the introduction of vCAC 5.2 when a data collection is run vCAC now ignores virtual machines with this value set to avoid this.\nIn addition to this SRM v5.5 introduced a second managed by property value which is placed on the virtual machine vCenter Server database record called ‘ManagedBy:SRM,testVM’ when a test recovery process is performed and data collection is run at the recovery site vCAC inspects this value and also ignores the virtual machines with this set to avoid creating a duplicate entry in the vCAC database.\nWith the changes highlighted above, SRM v5.5 and later and vCAC 5.2 and later can now be implemented in tandem with full awareness of the other. However one limitation still remains when moving a virtual machine into recovery or reprotect mode, vCAC does not properly recognize the move. To successfully perform these machine operations and continue being able to manage the machine life cycle, you must use the ‘Change Reservation’ operation, however this is still a manual task.\nIntroducing the CloudClient In performing the investigation around the enhancements between SRM and vCAC above, and on uncovering the need for the manual change of reservation I spent some time with our Cloud Solution Engineering team discussing the need for finding a way to automate this step. They were already developing a tool called CloudClient, which is essentially a wrapper for our API’s allowing simple command line driven steps to be performed and suggested that this could be developed to support this use case.\nConclusion In order to achieve a fully functional integration between vCloud Automation Center (5.2 or later) and vCenter Site Recovery Manager adhere to the following design decisions:\nConfigure vCloud Automation Center with endpoints for both the protected and recovery sites. Perform a manual / automatic change reservation following a vCenter Site Recovery Manager planned or disaster migration. Frequently Asked Questions Q: When I fail over my VMs from the protected site to the recovery site what happens when I request the built in vCAC machine operations?\nA: Once you have performed a ‘Planned Migration’ or a ‘Disaster Recovery’ process, as long as you have changed the reservation within the vCAC Admin UI for the VM, machine operations will be performed in the normal way on the recovered VM.\nQ: What happens if I do not perform the Change Reservation step to a VM once I’ve completed a ‘Planned Migration’ or ‘Disaster Recovery’ process and I then attempt to perform the built in vCAC machine operations on the VM?\nA: Depending on which tasks you perform, some things are blocked by vCAC and you see an error message in the log “The method is disabled by ‘com.vmware.vcDR’” and some actions look like they are being processed but nothing happens. There are also a few actions, which are processed regardless of the VM failure scenario; these are Change Lease and Expiration Reminder.\nQ: What happens if I perform a reprovision action on a VM that is currently in a ‘Planned Migration’ or ‘Disaster Recovery’ state?\nA: VCAC will reprovision the VM in the normal manner, which is that the hostname and IP Address (if assigned through vCAC) will be maintained. However the SRM recovery plan will now fail if you attempt to reprotect the VM back to the protected site as the original object being managed is replaced. It’s recommended that for blueprints where SRM protection is a requirement that you disable the ‘Reprovision’ machine operation.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2015/vcac-dr/","section":"archive","tags":["vCAC"],"title":"vCloud Automation Center Disaster Recovery"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2014/","section":"archive","tags":["index"],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"Replacing the self-signed certificate of any product with a CA Signed alterative is common place and in most security conscious organizations mandatory, whilst working on an internal project recently I attempted to achieve just that for my vCenter Log Insight Virtual Appliance.\nThe official VMware documentation posted here, in my opinion its very light in content on this subject in fact it only really describes how to replace the certificate by browsing for the .pem file and restarting the appliance. I’m no expert when it comes to SSL Certificates and so the whole process was a little bit of trial an error but thought I would share the process with the community in an effort to save others some time.\nFirstly, there are some specific requirements which are well documented these are:\nThe certificate file must contain both a valid private key and a valid certificate chain. The private key is generated by the RSA or the DSA algorithm. The private key is not encrypted by a pass phrase. If the certificate is signed by a chain of other certificates, all other certificates are included in the certificate file that you plan to import. The private key and all the certificates that are included in the certificate file are PEM-encoded. Log Insight does not support DER-encoded certificates and private keys. The private key and all the certificates that are included in the certificate file are in the PEM format. Log Insight does not support certificates in the PFX, PKCS12, PKCS7, or other formats. For the whole process I will be using OpenSSL tool for Windows, which I have installed to the C:\\OpenSSL folder.\nI also use the C:\\Certs folder to store the files being generated throughout the process, if you have ever read one of the VMware KB articles this will look familiar.\nThe end to end process can be split into following three stages, which is pretty standard of all VMware products where you want to replace the self-signed certificate:\nStage 1 – Generating the .csr file Launch a command prompt and navigate into the OpenSSL directory. In the C:\\Certs folder, create a folder for your Log Insight certificate files (C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight) Open a text editor on the system where OpenSSL is installed. Create a configuration file vCenter Log Insight containing the following values (items in red must be altered to match your environment), save the file. 1[ req ] 2default_md = sha512 3default_bits = 2048 4default_keyfile = rui.key 5distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name 6encrypt_key = no 7prompt = no 8string_mask = nombstr 9req_extensions = v3_req 10[ v3_req ] 11basicConstraints = CA:false 12keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment 13extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth 14subjectAltName = DNS:hostname, IP: xx.xx.xx.xx, DNS: hostname.domain.com 15[ req_distinguished_name ] 16countryName = UK 17stateOrProvinceName = London 18localityName = London 190.organizationName = VMware 20organizationalUnitName = vCenter Log Insight 21commonName = hostname.domain.com Generate the .csr file by running the following command: 1openssl req -new -nodes -out C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.csr -keyout C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui-orig.key -config C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\openssl-loginsight.cfg Convert the orig_rui.key into RSA format by running the following command: 1openssl rsa -in C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui-orig.key -out C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.key Stage 2 – Obtaining the Certificate Now you have your .csr file, using the Microsoft Certificate Authority generate your certificate file. I've not documented the process as this is document in many other blog posts, for reference take a look at Derek Seaman's blog here.\nStage 3 – Installing the Certificate Launch a command prompt and navigate into the OpenSSL directory. Next we need to merge the certificate, private key and CA Chain by generating a .pfx file by issuing the following command: 1openssl pkcs12 -export -in C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.crt -inkey C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.key -certfile C:\\Certs\\Root64.cer -name rui -passout pass:testpassword -out C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.pfx Now we need to convert the .pfx file into the format that the vCenter Log Insight Appliance accepts which is a .pem file by issuing the following command: 1openssl pkcs12 -nodes -in C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.pfx -out C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.pem Finally, you need to upload the rui.pem file into the appliance as per the VMware documentation.

During the engagement we had various issues around how to implement the Dell components. Dell have produced a best practice document but some elements of the document are a little light on the ground. This blog is a collection of tested procedures that we followed to prove the solution.\nSetting up the Environment During our testing we setup the environment using the following steps:\nSet up the LUNs and replication using Compellent Enterprise Manager client. Save the restore points using Enterprise Manager client. This is a manual process that Dell talks about within their Best Practice guide and must be done after all major SRM events. Set up datastores in vSphere and present them to the appropriate hosts. Create a Protection Group(s) in SRM for the newly created datastores. Create a Recovery Plan(s) in SRM for the newly created datastores. Configure SRM debug logging in both Data Collectors to collect SRM information. (We did this step in order to capture detailed logging to provide Dell if required.) Confirmed that the SiteA SRA was talking to the remote data collector (hosted in SiteA) and the SiteB SRA was talking to primary data collector (hosted in SiteB, as per Compellent Best Practice. NOTE\nThis configuration is not 100% clear in the best practice document and we were provided conflicting information from Dell Support when we asked for verification, the document did not define Primary vs Remote Data Collectors and simply referred to Enterprise Manager in both sites.\nDefining the Failover Procedure We defined the following procedure to be run during a failover type of Disaster Recovery:\nRun the Recovery Plan, selecting Disaster Recovery as the recovery type. Save the restore points using Enterprise Manager client, ignoring the inactive ones flagged. NOTE\nThe Compellent Best Practice document says that these can be removed, but our testing showed that this created errors at the re-protect stage so we skipped this process.\nRe-protect (to reverse replication) Save the restore points using Enterprise Manager client. Defining the Failback Procedure We defined the following procedure to be run during a failback type of Disaster Planned Migration:\nRun the same Recovery Plan as used for the Failover procedure, selecting Planned Migration as the recovery type. Save the restore points using Enterprise Manager client, ignoring the inactive ones flagged. NOTE\nThe Compellent Best Practice document says that these can be removed, but our testing showed that this created errors at the re-protect stage so we skipped this process.\nRe-protect (to reverse replication). Save the restore points using Enterprise Manager client. Test Scenarios After defining the procedures we then carried out the following tests to verify the process.\nTest 1 - Both Compellent Enterprise Manager Data Collectors Running Ensuring both data collectors were up and running, the failover procedure was run for the following scenarios:\nDR from SiteB to SiteA, virtual machine TESTVM001, hosted on datastore SRMTest_1 DR from SiteA to SiteB, virtual machine TESTVM001, hosted on datastore SRMTest_2 Both failovers completed without error, so we then followed the failback procedure to bring everything back to where it started. Both failback procedures completed without error.\nTest 2 - Primary Data Collector Shut Down Shutting down the primary data collector hosted at SiteB, we simulated a failure of SiteB and then ran the following scenario:\nDR from SiteB to SiteA, virtual machine TESTVM001, hosted on datastore SRMTest_1 The failover completed successfully, but with a number of errors at the following stages of the recovery plan:\nPre-Synchronise Storage Prepare Protected Site FMs for Migration Synchronise Storage None of these errors were fatal but they did mean that a re-protect of the protection group could not be completed until they had been resolved. This meant running a second Recovery once the Primary data collector was back online, this then completed successfully and then allowed a re-protect to run.\nWith both data collectors online, the failback procedure was then run to bring everything back to where it started. This completed without error.\nTest 3 - Remote Data Collector Shut Down Shutting down the remote data collector hosted in SiteA, we simulated a failure of SiteA and then ran the following scenario:\nDR from SiteA to SiteB, virtual machine TESTVM002, hosted on datastore SRMTest_2 This failover completed successfully, but with the same non-critical errors as seen in test 2 along the way. Resolution was the same as test 2, bringing the remote data collector back online and then running a second Recovery. This completed successfully and allowed a re-protect to run.\nWith both data collectors online, the failback procedure was then run to bring everything back to where it started. This completed without error.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2012/srm-dell-compellent/","section":"archive","tags":["SRM","Dell Compellent"],"title":"SRM 5 \u0026 Dell Compellent Best Practice Procedures"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/hds-storage/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"HDS Storage"},{"body":"These are notes on how to setup Site Recovery Manager (SRM) with HDS Storage using a command control device.\nIf using a VM for the SRM server ensure the following are configured before attempting to install the SRM components:\nRDM presented to the SRM VM, attached, initialized, but not formatted or assigned a drive letter.

Frequently Asked Questions Q: Does the SRA work at an individual Hitachi LUN level or HUR (Hitachi Universal Replicator) journal level ?\nA: HUR keeps all LUN pairs in the JNL group in the same status so if the pairs are split for a failover, all pairs in the JNL groups are split. The SRA cannot override this behavior. To split a single LUN it must be in a JNL group without any other LUNs.\nQ: Can SRA do split/sync for just one LUN ?\nA: Yes, depending on the configuration of HORCM but this is possible. The HUR pairs need to be created as single LUN/JNL group.\nQ: If we have multiple LUN's in same journal does it split all LUN's at same time?\nA: Yes\nQ: Does the SRA start a reverse sync immediately (Reverse P-VOL and S-VOL) once the secondary site is brought up?\nA: With SRM 4, HUR / TC do horctakeover so replication is reversed and if possible resync is run in the reverse direction. This behavior was changed for SRM 5 to support the additional functions. SRM 5 will only split and reverse the replication but will not resync until the reverseReplication function is called.\nQ: Do we have to create a separate HUR journal for each LUN, for individual LUN failover/failback?\nA: A separate JNL Group.\nUseful links http://www.hds.com/assets/pdf/hitachi-storage-replication-adapter-software-vmware-vcenter-site-recovery-manager-deployment-guide.pdf http://www.hds.com/solutions/applications/vmware/download.html\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2012/srm-hds-storage/","section":"archive","tags":["SRM","HDS Storage"],"title":"Installing SRM with HDS Storage"},{"body":"I don’t know how much experience any of you have in delivering the Spring Source Pet Clinic application which can be used as a good sample application when delivering VMware vCloud Director (vCD).

All three VMs are attached to the 192.168.2.0 network to allow the application to function as normal and the Windows VM has a second NIC set as the primary to the 192.168.3.x network.\nThe vApp is then connected to the External Organisation Network through a vShield Edge with NAT enabled on the 192.168.3.x network only. This provide the Windows VM with an IP address on the customers corporate LAN giving a direct RDP connection to the Windows VM in order to test and alter the application. The reason for creating the second vApp network was to limit the number of IPs needed when the vApp is powered as the customer could only provide 10 IPs.\nAdditional Management\nI additionally deployed a second management VM directly on the External Organisation Network and allocated two network cards one connected to it and the second attached to the Internal Organisation Network, this provided the added benefit of a jump box to allow access to the vApps deployed within the Internal Organisation. From the jump box the NATed IP of the Pet Clinic application can be used to access the application.\nAs I said before there are plenty of choices when configuring vCD and the above is just what I’ve set up recently to demonstrating the capabilities.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2011/pet-clinic/","section":"archive","tags":["vCloud Director"],"title":"Pet Clinic Application - vCloud PoC"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2011/","section":"archive","tags":["index"],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/vcd/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"VCD"},{"body":"In November 2011 VMware released the latest version of their free tool called vCloud Connector. The purpose of this application is to enable customers to migrate virtual machines between vSphere, Private vCloud and Public vCloud platforms. With the latest release there have been various enhancements which include:\nDirect Connectivity to vcloud.vmware.com New Architecture With the release of v1.5 the vCloud Connector architecture has been re-designed. VMware has created three distinct components:\nvCloud Connector UI - The vCloud Connector UI is the user interface, this can be presented to the vSphere Client or vcloud.vmware.com. vCloud Connector Server - The vCloud Connection Server is a virtual appliance that is deployed to manage and coordinate tasks. vCloud Connector Node - The vCloud Connector Nodes are virtual appliances that handle the transfer of content from one cloud to another.

As I find additional useful commands I will update. Enjoy !!\nDisable Firewall By default the Firewall service within Red Hat is enabled, when setting up the vCloud Director cells this will stop you from being able to hit the url once installed. Use the following commands to check and configure the firewall:\nCheck the firewall status 1/etc/init.d/iptables status Disable the firewall service 1/etc/init.d/iptables save 2/etc/init.d/iptables stop 3chkconfig iptables off or\n1service iptables save 2service iptables stop 3chkconfig iptables off Viewing Logs Using Tail When deploying the VMware vCloud Director cells, you will need to monitor the services starting in case any issues occur (DNS is always a good one). The Linux tail command is useful in this situation, by default tail will print the last 10 lines but with some additional values we can display more lines and follow the output as it changes. This can be achieved using the following commands:\n1tail –f -n 50 /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/logs/cell.log Checking Version of Red Hat If you want to double check the version of Red Hat your running then the following command can be issued:\n1tail /etc/redhat-release ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2011/redhat-cmds/","section":"archive","tags":["Linux"],"title":"Handy RedHat Commands"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/linux/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Linux"}]
