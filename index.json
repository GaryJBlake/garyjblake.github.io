Unless you rotate passwords on regular basis you may have overlooked this default configuration and suddenly find yourself locked out of being able to perform management tasks.\nFirstly in more recent releases, VMware Cloud Foundation provides the ability to perform scheduled or manual password rotations something to consider looking into from a day-to-day operational process but if your passwords have already expired all bets are off as the VMware Cloud Foundation password rotation workflow can no longer authenticate. Thinking the password rotation feature may be a way out very quickly presents you with the following error message:\nDescription Password update for resource : sfo-m01-nsx01.sfo.rainpole.io, user : admin and credential type : API Message Failed to get NSXT user details Remediation Message Please verify that the account is active and is not locked. If the password of the account has expired, manually reset the password in the product and then perform a REMEDIATE operation in the SDDC Manager, to update its stored copy of the password. Reference Token HDDF8C Cause The credentials were incorrect or the account specified has been locked. In a fairly small deployment the process of resetting the passwords is not a speedy process, for example in a Standard Architecture deployment of VMware Cloud Foundation with a single NSX Edge Cluster deployed in each Workload Domain the NSX Appliance count is already a total of ten (10). Not withstanding this, personally I found very little information on the internet that explained a single end-to-end process or in fact the best approach in order to rectify the situation. For example the message from VMware Cloud Foundation itself suggests a number of steps, including the remediate option which frankly just adds further time to the process.\nBecause of this I decided to spend a little bit of time investigating the options with a view to documenting what I found to be the fastest approach to get things unblocked. In essence this really boils down to adjusting the expiration policy to never expire initially, it removes the need to manually update all of the passwords and then perform remediation within VMware Cloud Foundation and once your unblocked you can either continue using the original passwords and the never expire policy setting or look to use a combination of VMware Cloud Foundation scheduled password rotations and a complementary expiration timeline.\nLet's take a look at the process I followed in my lab, which involves a combination of nsxcli commands executed on the console and some cmdlets that have been recently added to PowerValidatedSolutions which use the NSX REST APIs.\nResolving Expired Passwords for an NSX Management Cluster The first step in the process is unlocking the NSX Management Cluster, this has to be done through a console on one of the NSX Manager appliances, the good news though is that as this is a cluster you only need to make the change on one of the NSX Manager nodes.\nLogin to the Management Domain vCenter Server. Open a remote or web console to the first NSX Manager node of the cluster. Login using the root account and the original password. You will be prompted to change the password immediately, follow the on-screen prompts to change the root password. Now your authenticated we can disable password expiry for each account using the following sudo commands (pay careful attention to the syntax): 1su admin \u0026#39;-c clear user admin password-expiration\u0026#39; 1su admin \u0026#39;-c clear user audit password-expiration\u0026#39; 1su admin \u0026#39;-c clear user root password-expiration\u0026#39; Now the accounts are set to no longer expire, we reset the root account back to the original password also using a sudo command: 1 su admin \u0026#39;-c set user root password VMw@re1!VMw@re1! old-password VMware123!VMware123!\u0026#39; All accounts should be available for connection using the original passwords. Resolving Expired Passwords for NSX Edge Nodes The second step in the process is to unlock the NSX Edge Nodes, for this process now we have the admin account of the NSX Manager working again we can use the NSX REST APIs to simplify the process. In this procedure we use a number of PowerShell cmdlets that have been included in PowerValidatedSolutions, you could simply use the APIs directly on the command line but having the APIs wrapped in PowerShell cmdlets simplifies the process for many.\nEnsure you have followed the prerequisites for installing the PowerValidatedSolutions PowerShell module and have it installed.\nStart Windows PowerShell.\nReplace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.\n1$nsxtManagerFqdn = \u0026#34;sfo-m01-nsx01.sfo.rainpole.io\u0026#34; 2$nsxtManagerUser = \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; 3$nsxtManagerPass = \u0026#34;VMw@re1!VMw@re1!\u0026#34; Perform the configuration by running the command in the PowerShell console. 1Request-NsxToken -fqdn $nsxtManagerFqdn -username $nsxtManagerUser -password $nsxtManagerPass 2$transportNodeIds = (Get-NsxtEdgeCluster).members.transport_node_id 3$userIds = @(\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10002\u0026#34;) 4foreach ($id in $transportNodeIds ) { 5 foreach ($userId in $userIds) { 6 Set-NsxtApplianceUserExpirationPolicy -userId $userId -days 0 -transportNodeId $id 7 } 8} All your NSX Edge Node accounts should also now be unblocked and set to never expire.

VMware Cloud Foundation includes the following types of bundles.\nInstall Bundles, An install bundle includes software binaries to install VI workload domains and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. Update or Upgrade Bundle, An update or upgrade bundle includes software binaries to update the appropriate VMware Cloud Foundation software components. In most cases, an upgrade bundle must be applied to the management domain before it can be applied to VI workload domains. Async Patch Bundle, An async patch bundle allows you to apply critical patches to certain VMware Cloud Foundation components (NSX-T Manager, vCenter Server, and ESXi) when an update or upgrade bundle is not available. See Async Patch Tool. This process can be a little overwhelming if you are new to VMware Cloud Foundation due to the nature in which the bundles are displayed under the Bundle Management section of the SDDC Manager UI. One of my biggest gripes here is there is no way to filter the bundles based on VMware Cloud Foundation version, product or even date. This coupled with the way they are actually displayed in the UI from a layout perspective, a table list would be easier to consume in my opinion. When you start the process of walking through the upgrade process itself, the SDDC Manager UI is actually very good at leading you down the What's Next path as you can actually only upgrade components in a particular order and this is illustrated when you select Available Updates from within a Workload Domain. If you have not pre-downloaded all the required bundles you then waste time within your change window completing this task before you can continue and so are back to needing to traverse the overwhelming Bundle Management section of the SDDC Manager UI again.\nIts for this reason that I decided to put together a very simple PowerShell script that utilizes PowerVCF to automate the process of downloading all of the bundles required for a particular release.\nUsing a JSON file, you first populate it with the bundle IDs of each bundle required. This can be done by reviewing the details of each bundle in the Bundle Management section of the SDDC Manager UI for the release you wish to prepare for. Here is a sample for VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.1.0. You can also download it from GitHub.\n1{ 2 \u0026#34;bundles\u0026#34;: [ 3 { 4 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;13d87a53-298d-4ee5-98ca-b9e10eece7a5\u0026#34;, 5 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SDDC_MANAGER\u0026#34; 6 }, 7 { 8 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8c178f33-b28d-47d0-88da-aa94f309a042\u0026#34;, 9 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SDDC_MANAGER_CONFIG_DRIFT\u0026#34; 10 }, 11 { 12 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;05be2afd-990d-45bd-9472-fab032e8c696\u0026#34;, 13 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;VCENTER_SERVER_UPGRADE\u0026#34; 14 }, 15 { 16 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;043e2b99-b36f-45b9-a4a2-1632a24764ef\u0026#34;, 17 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ESXI_UPGRADE\u0026#34; 18 }, 19 { 20 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;193486eb-53f5-40c7-8012-b5dcab515ebf\u0026#34;, 21 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NSXT_UPGRADE\u0026#34; 22 }, 23 { 24 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;05be2afd-990d-45bd-9472-fab032e8c696\u0026#34;, 25 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;VCENTER_SERVER\u0026#34; 26 }, 27 { 28 \u0026#34;bundleId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3c32c5d6-b5e0-49c6-9a86-90bcd3de671e\u0026#34;, 29 \u0026#34;product\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NSXT_INSTALL\u0026#34; 30 } 31 ] 32} Next we simply execute the vcfBundleDownload.ps1 script passing in the JSON file. The script reads the JSON, then loops through each entry first checking if the bundle has been downloaded and if not requests a download. It then monitors the download until complete before moving onto the next bundle item. You can execute the the script over and over in case a download fails and you need to re-run safe in the knowledge that it will only download missing bundles.\n1.\\vcfBundleDownload.ps1 -json .\\vcfBundleDownloadList.json Download the script from GitHub.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-post-11/","section":"post","tags":["API","VCF","PowerShell"],"title":"Automating the Download of VCF Bundles for a Release"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/series/vvs-whats-new/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"VVS Whats New"},{"body":"Last Updated 31-05-2022 VMware Validated Solutions are byte sized solutions developed to extend the foundational capabilities of VMware Cloud Foundation, for background reading see my previous post here.

Each Validated Solution provides both UI and Infrastructure-as-code based procedures. The Infrastructure-as-code method is delivered through the use of a PowerShell module specifically created to support Validated Solutions called PowerValidatedSolutions, each UI based procedure has a PowerShell cmdlet equivalent that not only performs the operation but ensures pre and post validation checks are performed to provide robustness.\nIncluded with the PowerValidatedSolution PowerShell module which can be installed directly from the Microsoft PS Gallery there is a SampleScripts folder and contained within that a folder named iam which contains sample .ps1 script files. These sample scripts demonstrate linking multiple procedures into a single executable script using the Planning and Preparation Workbook as the input for all data.\nFor the Identity and Access Management solution this is broken down into three phases and therefore three scripts as follows:\nvSphere and SDDC Manager Workspace ONE Access NSX-T Data Center As already mentioned the scripts use the Planning and Preparation Workbook to obtain all the required inputs, this is the first step in the execution. The script checks that the path provided to the workbook is valid and then opens the workbook, reading the required information using named cells.\nOnce that step is complete it begins the process of executing each procedure based on the order of steps defined within the implementation guide.\nIn addition to providing the main cmdlets supporting the validated solution implementation procedures a number of cmdlets are included that provide supporting capabilities which are utilised by the scripts.\nStart-SetupLogFile - this cmdlet is used to configure a log file where the output of each step is logged. Write-LogMessage - this cmdlet is used to format the output of messages both to the console and log file. Debug-CatchWriter - this cmdlet is used to provide a consistent way of displaying exception errors should they occur. For each procedure executed by the script, the output is captured into variables and then redirected to the Write-LogMessage cmdlet for display to the console and log in a consistent way. There are three types of output messages :\nINFO - Used for informational messages and successful execution of a procedure. WARNING - Used when a procedure is skipped due to the process already being executed. ERROR - Used to display a failure along with the failure reason. Let’s now take a deeper look at the scripts.\nvSphere and SDDC Manager (iamConfigureVsphere.ps1) The iamConfigureVsphere.ps1 script automates all the procedures associated with ESXi, vCenter Server and SDDC Manager. This includes:\nAdd Identity Provider to vCenter Server. This adds Active Directory over LDAP or LDAPS to vCenter Server making Active Directory users and groups available to both vCenter Server and SDDC Manager for assigning access control. Assign Global Permissions. This assigns the vCenter Server Administrator and Read Only roles to corresponding groups in Active Directory. Assign Single Sign-On Permissions. This assigns the Single Sign-On Administrator role to a corresponding group in Active Directory. Configure vCenter Server Appliance password expiration policy. Configure Single Sign-On password and lockout polices. Assign SDDC Manager Roles. This assigns the Admin, Operator and Viewer roles to corresponding groups in Active Directory. Configure ESXi password and lockout polices. Execution of the iamConfigureVsphere.ps1 script is performed by using the following command:\n1.\\SampleScripts\\iam\\iamConfigureVsphere.ps1 -sddcManagerFqdn sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io -sddcManagerUser administrator@vsphere.local -sddcManagerPass VMw@re1! -workbook F:\\vvs\\PnP.xlsx -filePath F:\\vvs Workspace ONE Access (iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1) The iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1 script automates the deployment and configuration of Workspace ONE Access. This includes:\nCreating a Virtual Machine folder in vCenter Server. Deploying the Workspace ONE Access .ova. Performing the configuration of Workspace ONE Access: Initial configuration. This assigns the root, admin and sshuser credentials. Configure NTP settings. Configure SMTP server settings. Install a signed-certificate. Configure password policy. Add Identity Provider to Workspace ONE Access. This adds Active Directory over LDAP or LDAPS to Workspace ONE Access making Active Directory users and groups available. Assign Workspace ONE Access Permissions. This assigns the Super Admin, Directory Admin and Read Only Admin to corresponding groups in Active Directory. Create VM Group. This creates a VM Group in vCenter Server and assigns the Workspace ONE Access virtual machine to it. Execution of the iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1 script is performed by using the following command:\n1.\\SampleScripts\\iam\\iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1 -sddcManagerFqdn sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io -sddcManagerUser administrator@vsphere.local -sddcManagerPass VMw@re1! -workbook F:\\vvs\\PnP.xlsx -filePath F:\\vvs NSX-T Data Center (iamConfigureNsx.ps1) The iamConfigureNsx.ps1 script automates the integration between the NSX Managers and Workspace ONE Access. Whilst it is possible to configure NSX-T Data Center with a direct connection to Active Directory over LDAP, the Identity and Access Management solution uses Workspace ONE Access which provides additional methods for connecting to authentication sources. This includes:\nEnable Integration between NSX Manager and Workspace ONE Access. Assign NSX-T Data Center Permissions. This assigns Enterprise Admin, Network Engineer and Auditor roles to corresponding groups in Active Directory for both the Management and Workload Domains. Configure Authentication Policies. This configure the authentication policies on the NSX Manager and NSX Edge Nodes for both the Management and Workload Domains. Create a custom role in vCenter Server. Assign Single Sign-On Permissions. This assigns the License Administration role to the NSX Manager service account used by SDDC Manager. Reduce vCenter Server Permissions. This reduces the permissions a specific vCenter Server service account has for other vCenter Servers within the Single Sign-On domain. Execution of the iamConfigureNsx.ps1 script is performed by using the following command:\n1.\\SampleScripts\\iam\\iamConfigureNsx.ps1 -sddcManagerFqdn sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io -sddcManagerUser administrator@vsphere.local -sddcManagerPass VMw@re1! -workbook F:\\vvs\\PnP.xlsx -filePath F:\\vvs After execution of these scripts in the order described above, and assuming that each step completed successfully your environment is fully configured based on the design and implementation procedures documented within the Identity and Access Management for VMware Cloud Foundation Validated Solution.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-post-01/","section":"post","tags":["API","PowerShell","VVS"],"title":"End-to-End Automation of Identity and Access Management Validated Solution"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/categories/powercli/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"PowerCLI"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/series/powervalidatedsolutions/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"PowerValidatedSolutions"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/series/vvs-tip/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"VVS-Tip"},{"body":"Are you using the PowerValidatedSolutions PowerShell module?

For production environments its critical that this is changed before going live to ensure that you have the ability to recover in the event of a disaster.\nThe requirements of using an SFTP in my experience seem to fall through the gaps during most initial deployments and as a result it takes organizations some time to get all the requirements put in place. Such delays simply place a risk on the implementation until addressed.\nOne way to reduce this risk, and of course for use in a lab environment is to use VMware Cloud Builder as an alternative short term solution as it too has an SFTP service running, this can be achieved through a simple three step process:\nCreate a Backup Service Account on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance Create a Backup Folder on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance Re-Configure the Backup in SDDC Manager Create a Backup Service Account on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance First step is to create a local account on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance, this will be used as the service account and is supplied when re-configuring the backup configuration in SDDC Manager.\nConnect to the SDDC Manager Appliance using an SSH client such as Putty, and authenticate as admin.\nSwitch to root by entering the following command:\n1su Create the service account by entering the following command: 1useradd -m -p $(openssl passwd -1 VMw@re1!) svc-vcf-bck Create a Backup Folder on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance The next step is to create a target backup folder on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance and assign the appropriate access to allow the service account to store backup jobs.\nCreate a new folder by entering the following command: 1mkdir /tmp/vcf-backups Configure access to the folder for the service account by entering the following command: 1chown svc-vcf-bck:users /tmp/vcf-backups Re-Configure the Backup in SDDC Manager And finally you re-configure the backup configuration to use the new SFTP target for backups, performing this task will trigger SDDC Manager to automatically reconfigure SDDC Manager and NSX-T Data Center.\nLogin to the SDDC Manager UI with a user assigned with the ADMIN role.\nUsing the navigation paine, select Administration \u0026gt; Backup.\nOn the Backup paine, select Site Settings and click Register External. Enter the values, and click Save.\nSetting Value Host FQDN or IP sfo-cb01.sfo.rainpole.io Port 22 Transfer Protocol SFTP Username svc-vcf-bck Password VMw@re1! Backup Directory /tmp/vcf-backups Confirm Fingerprint Selected Encryption Passphares VMw@re1!VMw@re1! On the Confirm your changes to backup settings dialog, click Confirm. Your details will be saved and the Configure Backup of VCF Components (SDDC Manager and NSX Managers) task will start. NOTE\nThe SDDC Manager UI procedure is valid for VMware Cloud Foundation 4.3.0 and later.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-post-10/","section":"post","tags":["API","VCF","PowerShell","Backup"],"title":"Configure VMware Cloud Builder as a Backup Target for SDDC Manager"},{"body":"Last Updated: 10-Nov-2021\nVMware Validated Solutions are byte sized solutions developed to extend the foundational capabilities of VMware Cloud Foundation, for background reading see my previous post here.

Greenfield Deployments Only The first thing to note is that this release is only for greenfield deployments and does not include an upgrade process from previous versions of the VMware Validated Design at this current time. There are a number of reasons for this but read on to find out more.\nBill of Materials One of the most significant changes relates to the Bill of Materials (BoM) and this centers around, vSphere 7.0, NSX-T Data Center 3.0, vRealize Suite 8.1, Workspace ONE Access 3.3, and the most significant change the inclusion of VMware Cloud Foundation 4.0 at the heart of the solution.\nPlanning and Preparation Workbook Starting with this release the static Planning and Preparation document has been ported over into an Excel Workbook, this has been done to enable customers to use it as more of a tool allowing customer inputs along side the VMware Validated Design examples to aid with the deployment process. The workbook is also shared between VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware Validated Design.\nvSphere 7.0 Design From an vSphere 7.0 architecture perspective the biggest change is the deprecation of external Platform Services Controllers in vCenter Server and as a result all vCenter Servers now use an embedded Platform Services Controller which also means there is no longer a requirement for an NSX based Load Balancer.\nvSAN 7.0 Design The design changes for VSAN include All-Flash by default and a minimum of two disk groups in line with VMware best practices.\nNSX-T Data Center 3.0 Design NSX-V has been completely removed, both the Management Domain and Workload Domains now use NSX-T Data Center for all Software-Defined Networking capabilities.\nvRealize Suite 8.1 The design to the vRealize Suite includes vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, vRealize Operations Manager, vRealize Log Insight, and vRealize Automation.\nThe biggest change here is in relation to vRealize Automation where the Windows based DEMs, Orchestrators, and Agents are gone so is the requirement for a Microsoft SQL Server.\nThere are minimal changes for vRealize Operations Manager and vRealize Log Insight but a point of note is that vRealize Business for Cloud is no longer a part of the solution.\nWorkspace ONE Access 3.3 New to the VMware Validated Design we have included Workspace ONE Access to provide a single entry point for authentication from an external provider such as Active Directory. Workspace ONE Access is also used to deliver Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for NSX-T Data Center specifically as without there is no way to provide such controls.\nVMware Cloud Foundation 4.0 Whilst I’ve not mentioned anything about VMware Cloud Foundation 4.0 until now this is probably the most significant change to the VMware Validation Design. From this release forward the design will include VMware Cloud Foundation at the heart, which means that all architecture design elements between what VMware Cloud Foundation implements are 100% aligned with the VMware Validated Design. In a nutshell this means where VMware Cloud Foundation has an automated workflow the end state maps directly to the architecture design documented in the VMware Validated Design Architecture and Design documentation.\nMore importantly where VMware Cloud Foundation has no automated workflow then the VMware Validated Design will contain complimentary architecture design and deployment guidance covering the gaps\nAnything Else to be Aware of? Multi-Region - Unfortunately due to constraints in underlying products this release of the VMware Validated Design is only applicable for a single region, the plan is to add multi region support in a future release once support is available.\nModular Documentation Structure - The Architecture and Design, and Deployment Guides are broken up into modular components covering Management Domain, Workload Domain and Cloud Operations and Automation Solution which should make it easier to consume.\nUseful Links VMware Validated Design Documentation VMware Validated Design 6.0 Release Notes Planning and Preparation Workbook ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2020/vvd-whats-new-600/","section":"archive","tags":["VVD"],"title":"VMware Validated Design 6.0 - What’s New"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/vvd/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"VVD"},{"body":" If you follow my posts you will know that in January I posted about the release of PowerVCF which is a PowerShell based CLI that exposes the public APIs of VMware Cloud Foundation to be easily consumed by VI Admins (see Introducing PowerVCF – Power to VI Admins).\nAs mentioned before PowerVCF is a open source project and the team has been working hard in their spare time to continue to evolve the cmdlets it offers. I'm pleased to announce that as a result of all this hard work we have made v1.2.0 available on the PowerShell Library for download.\nDownload It Here: PowerVCF PowerShell Library Download\nWhat's New in PowerVCF v1.2.0 The latest release introduces a number of new cmdlets:\nCategorycmdlet NameDescriptionBackup and RestoreSet-VCFBackupConfigurationConfigure backup settings for NSX and SDDC managerCredentialsRetry-VCFCredentialTaskConnects to the specified SDDC Manager and retry a failed rotate/update passwords taskCredentialsGet-VCFCredentialTaskConnects to the specified SDDC Manager and retrieves a list of credential tasks in reverse chronological orderFederationSet-VCFFederationBootstrap a VMware Cloud Foundation to form a federationSystem PrechecksStart-PreCheckVCFSystemPerforms system level health checksSystem PrechecksGet-PreCheckVCFSystemTaskPerforms retrieval of a system precheck task that can be polled and monitoredAVNGet-VCFApplicationVirtualNetworkRetrieves all Application Virtual NetworksvRSLCMNew-VCFvRSLCMDeploy vRealize Suite Lifecycle ManagervRSLCMRemove-VCFvRSLCMRemove a failed vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager deployment VMware Cloud Foundation Documentation VMware Cloud Foundation General FAQ VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9 Release Notes VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9.1 Release Notes PowerVCF Documentation PowerVCF PowerShell Library Download ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-120/","section":"post","tags":["API","PowerShell","VCF"],"title":"PowerVCF v1.2.0 - General Availability"},{"body":"Whilst working with VMware Cloud Foundation recently I wanted to implement an additional level of security around the process of certificate management. For those that don't know in the current release in order to integrate SDDC Manager with your Microsoft Certificate Authority you have to enable basic authentication (see PowerVCF – Configure the Microsoft Certificate Authority for VMware Cloud Foundation Integration (Part 1) on reviewing the official documentation I found nothing to explain the minimum requirements as is it related to least privilege access so I set about trying to figure it out.\nWhat I found is that it is indeed possible but it has to be done in two specific locations as follows:\nConfigure Microsoft Certificate Authority Server Configure Microsoft Certificate Authority Template Let's now take a look at what you need to do. In this example I'm using a dedicated service account called svc-mgr-ca which is just a Domain User.\nConfigure Microsoft Certificate Authority Server Log in to the Microsoft Certificate Authority server by using a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client.Configure least privilege access for svc-mgr-ca on the Microsoft Certificate Authority.Click Start \u0026gt; Run, enter certsrv.msc, and click OK.Right-click the certificate authority and click Properties.Click the Security tab, and click Add.Enter the svc-mgr-ca service account and click OK.In the Permissions for svc-mgr-ca section configure the following permissions and click OK. Configure Microsoft Certificate Authority Template Configure least privilege access for svc-mgr-ca on the Microsoft Certificate Authority Template.Click Start \u0026gt; Run, enter certtmpl.msc, and click OK.Right-click the VMware template and click Properties.Click the Security tab, and click Add.Enter the svc-mgr-ca service account and click OK.In the Permissions for svc-mgr-ca section configure the following permissions and click OK. Now you should be able to configure SDDC Manager to use the svc-mgr-ca service account and perform all certificate operations.\nUseful Links If you would like to learn more about VMware Cloud Foundation or PowerVCF, check out these links:\nVMware Cloud Foundation Documentation VMware Cloud Foundation General FAQ VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9 Release Notes VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9.1 Release Notes PowerVCF Documentation PowerVCF PowerShell Library Download ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2020/powervcf-certificates-06/","section":"archive","tags":["API","PowerShell","VCF"],"title":"Creating a Service Account for Certificate Management with VMware Cloud Foundation"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/series/vcf-certificate-management/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"VCF Certificate Management"},{"body":"This is the fifth and final blog in this series that discusses the process of Certificate Management with VMware Cloud Foundation.\nIn this post we will look at the process of installing the signed certificates using SDDC Manager.\nInstall Signed Certificates using the User Interface The following procedure demonstrates the process through the SDDC Manager User Interface.\nProcedure\nLog in to SDDC Manager using a web browser.Open a Web browser and go to\u0026nbsp;https://lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local.Log in using the administrator@vsphere.local user accountNavigate to Inventory \u0026gt; Workload Domains.In the Workload Domains window, under Virtual Infrastructure VI select View Details. In the Virtual Infrastructure (VI) window, select MGMT from the Domain column. Select the Security tab. Select the checkbox in the table header to select all resource types and click Install Certificates. NOTE: If you have not completed the Generate CSR and Generate Signed Certificates steps then refer to Parts 3 and Part 4 of this series.\nOnce complete the User Interface is updated with a status message of Certificate Installation is successful along with the message Added root certificate chain to the SDDC Manager keystore, you need to restart the SDDC Manager services manually (refer documentation).\nConnect to SDDC Manager lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local using an SSH client such as Putty.Log in using the vcf user account.Switch to root using the su command.Restart all the SDDC Manager services. Enter the following command and enter Y. /opt/vmware/vcf/operationsmanager/scripts/cli/sddcmanager_restart_services.sh Wait for the services to restart, then on logging back into the User Interface you will see the warning message has gone and just the Certificate Installation is successful remains.\nInstall Signed Certificates using using PowerVCF The following procedure demonstrates the process through PowerVCF.\nAssumption: You have already installed or imported PowerVCF on your system.\nProcedure\nBefore performing any operations on SDDC Manager using PowerVCF you must enter the credentials, the PowerVCF cmdlet Request-VCFToken takes these credentials and stores them as a base64 string which is then used for each subsequent cmdlet. Enter the following syntax.\nConnect-VCFManager -fqdn lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local -username admin -password \"VMw@re1!\" The process of generating the signed certificates via PowerVCF requires passing a JSON spec containing the required input details as follows:\n{ \"operationType\": \"\", \"resources\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"\", \"name\": \"\", \"resourceId\": \"\", \"type\": \"\" }] } The operationType element supports INSTALL. In our example we will now enter INSTALL as follows.\n{ \"operationType\": \"INSTALL\", \"resources\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"\", \"name\": \"\", \"resourceId\": \"\", \"type\": \"\" }] } Next we need to populate the resources part of the JSON spec for each component we want to install the certificate for. To achieve this we need the following four elements of information for each component (just like we did for generating the CSR files and creating the signed certificates):\nfqdn - The fully distinguished domain name as it relates to the information stored in the SDDC Manager inventory.name - The hostname which can be derived from the fqdnresourceId - The unique id assigned to the component and stored in the SDDC Manager inventory.type - The flag to identify what type of component the resources is, SDDC Manager has the following resource types SDDC_MANAGER, PSC, VCENTER, NSX_MANAGER, NSXT_MANAGER, VRA, VRLI, VROPS, VRSLCM, VXRAIL_MANAGER In this example we are going to include VCENTER and SDDC_MANAGER resource types, and using the Get-VCFvCenter and Get-VCFManager cmdlets we can obtain the fqdn and resourceIds details.\nFirst lets look at the Get-VCFvCenter cmdlet. Enter the following syntax:\nGet-VCFvCenter | select id,fqdn Using the select command we can return just the id and fqdn details which is all we need for the JSON spec, using this information we can now build the resource section like this:\n{ \"operationType\": \"INSTALL\", \"resources\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"lax01m01vc01.lax.rainpole.local\", \"name\": \"lax01m01vc01\", \"resourceId\": \"a0652869-dc9b-426a-a9f6-f2866830dceb\", \"type\": \"VCENTER\" } ] } Next we want to do the same for SDDC Manager using the Get-VCFManager cmdlet. Enter the following syntax:\nGet-VCFManager | select id,fqdn Add this additional information to our JSON spec file as follows, and then save the file in this example I call it updateCertificateSpec.json.\n{ \"operationType\": \"INSTALL\", \"resources\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"lax01m01vc01.lax.rainpole.local\", \"name\": \"lax01m01vc01\", \"resourceId\": \"a0652869-dc9b-426a-a9f6-f2866830dceb\", \"type\": \"VCENTER\" },{ \"fqdn\": \"lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local\", \"name\": \"lax01mgr01\", \"resourceId\": \"41290562-a6a5-4d3b-8f3c-25b0dd5535f6\", \"type\": \"SDDC_MANAGER\" } ] } Now we have our JSON spec ready we can perform the process of installing the signed certificates using the Set-VCFCertificate cmdlet. When executing this cmdlet we need to provide two inputs, first the name of the Workload Domain, in this example we are using MGMT and the json file we have just created. Enter the following syntax:\nSet-VCFCertificate -domainName MGMT -json E:\\MyLab\\updateCertificateSpec.json After executing this command you are presented with a response which relates to a Task ID and the status of the request, you can check the status of the request using the Get-VCFTask cmdlet. Enter the following syntax:\nGet-VCFTask d6c66f48-e95f-4382-8945-45ca2efc12e0 | select id,name,status Here we can see a task is named Certificate Operation: REPLACE_CERTIFICATE and it has a status of IN_PROGRESS. This step takes some time as it cycles through the components, you can issue the same Get-VCFTask command over and over until the status changes to SUCCESSFUL as follows.\nThe final step in the process is to restart the SDDC Manager services.\nConnect to SDDC Manager lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local using an SSH client such as Putty.Log in using the vcf user account.Switch to root using the su command.Restart all the SDDC Manager services. Enter the following command and enter Y. /opt/vmware/vcf/operationsmanager/scripts/cli/sddcmanager_restart_services.sh And there you have it we have successfully replaced the vCenter Server and SDDC Manager systems with CA Signed Certificates using both the User Interface and PowerVCF.\nI hope you have found this series of posts helpful.\nUseful Links If you would like to learn more about VMware Cloud Foundation or PowerVCF, check out these links:\nVMware Cloud Foundation Documentation VMware Cloud Foundation General FAQ VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9 Release Notes VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9.1 Release Notes PowerVCF Documentation PowerVCF PowerShell Library Download ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2020/powervcf-certificates-05/","section":"archive","tags":["API","PowerShell","VCF"],"title":"PowerVCF - Install Signed Certificates on Each Component Managed by SDDC Manager (Part 5)"},{"body":"This is the fourth of five blogs in the series that discusses the process of Certificate Management with VMware Cloud Foundation.\nIn this post we will look at the process of requesting the signed certificates from the Microsoft Certificate Authority using SDDC Manager.

Enter the following syntax.\nConnect-VCFManager -fqdn lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local -username admin -password \"VMw@re1!\" The process of generating the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) files via PowerVCF requires passing a JSON spec containing the required input details as follows:\n{ \"csrGenerationSpec\": { \"country\": \"\", \"email\": \"\", \"keyAlgorithm\": \"\", \"keySize\": \"\", \"locality\": \"\", \"organization\": \"\", \"organizationUnit\": \"\", \"state\": \"\" }, \"resources\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"\", \"name\": \"\", \"resourceId\": \"\", \"type\": \"\" } ] } The csrGenerationSpec maps directly to the same details we entered via the User Interface and would look like this:\n{ \"csrGenerationSpec\": { \"country\": \"US\", \"email\": \"\", \"keyAlgorithm\": \"RSA\", \"keySize\": \"2048\", \"locality\": \"Palo Alto\", \"organization\": \"VMware\", \"organizationUnit\": \"HCIBU\", \"state\": \"CA\" } } Next we need to populate the resources part of the JSON spec for each component we want to generate a CSR for. To achieve this we need the following four elements of information for each component:\nfqdn - The fully distinguished domain name as it relates to the information stored in the SDDC Manager inventory.name - The hostname which can be derived from the fqdnresourceId - The unique id assigned to the component and stored in the SDDC Manager inventory.type - The flag to identify what type of component the resources is, SDDC Manager has the following resource types SDDC_MANAGER, PSC, VCENTER, NSX_MANAGER, NSXT_MANAGER, VRA, VRLI, VROPS, VRSLCM, VXRAIL_MANAGER In this example we are going to include VCENTER and SDDC_MANAGER resource types, and using the Get-VCFvCenter and Get-VCFManager cmdlets we can obtain the fqdn and resourceIds details.\nFirst lets look at the Get-VCFvCenter cmdlet. Enter the following syntax:\nGet-VCFvCenter | select id,fqdn Using the select command we can return just the id and fqdn details which is all we need for the JSON spec, using this information we can now build the resource section like this:\n{ \"csrGenerationSpec\": { \"country\": \"US\", \"email\": \"\", \"keyAlgorithm\": \"RSA\", \"keySize\": \"2048\", \"locality\": \"Palo Alto\", \"organization\": \"VMware\", \"organizationUnit\": \"HCIBU\", \"state\": \"CA\" }, \"resources\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"lax01m01vc01.lax.rainpole.local\", \"name\": \"lax01m01vc01\", \"resourceId\": \"a0652869-dc9b-426a-a9f6-f2866830dceb\", \"type\": \"VCENTER\" } ] } Next we want to do the same for SDDC Manager using the Get-VCFManager cmdlet. Enter the following syntax:\nGet-VCFManager | select id,fqdn Add this additional information to our JSON spec file as follows, and then save the file in this example I call it requestCsrSpec.json.\n{ \"csrGenerationSpec\": { \"country\": \"US\", \"email\": \"\", \"keyAlgorithm\": \"RSA\", \"keySize\": \"2048\", \"locality\": \"Palo Alto\", \"organization\": \"VMware\", \"organizationUnit\": \"HCIBU\", \"state\": \"CA\" }, \"resources\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"lax01m01vc01.lax.rainpole.local\", \"name\": \"lax01m01vc01\", \"resourceId\": \"a0652869-dc9b-426a-a9f6-f2866830dceb\", \"type\": \"VCENTER\" },{ \"fqdn\": \"lax01mgr01.lax.rainpole.local\", \"name\": \"lax01mgr01\", \"resourceId\": \"41290562-a6a5-4d3b-8f3c-25b0dd5535f6\", \"type\": \"SDDC_MANAGER\" } ] } Now we have our JSON spec ready we can perform the process of creating the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) files using the Request-VCFCertificateCSRs cmdlet. When executing this cmdlet we need to provide two inputs, first the name of the Workload Domain, in this example we are using MGMT and the json file we have just created. Enter the following syntax:\nRequest-VCFCertificateCSRs -domainName MGMT -json E:\\MyLab\\requestCsrSpec.json After executing this command you are presented with a response which relates to a Task ID and the status, the generation is pretty quick but you can check the status of the task using the Get-VCFTask cmdlet. Enter the following synatx:\nGet-VCFTask e87379ea-ad57-422d-bbfa-bff8c39c810a | select id,name,status Here we can see a task is named Certificate Operation: GENERATE_CSR and it has a status of SUCCESSFUL. So there you have it we have successfully generated the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) files using PowerVCF.\nUseful Links If you would like to learn more about VMware Cloud Foundation or PowerVCF, check out these links:\nVMware Cloud Foundation Documentation VMware Cloud Foundation General FAQ VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9 Release Notes VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9.1 Release Notes PowerVCF Documentation PowerVCF PowerShell Library Download ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2020/powervcf-certificates-03/","section":"archive","tags":["API","PowerShell","VCF"],"title":"PowerVCF - Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Files for Each Component Managed by SDDC Manager (Part 3)"},{"body":"This is the second of five blogs in the series that discusses the process of Certificate Management with VMware Cloud Foundation.\nIn this post we will look at the process of configuring SDDC Manager integration with the Microsoft Certificate Authority.

When you deploy the OVA you pass a SKU value of vcf for VMware Cloud Foundation, vcf-vxrail for VMware Cloud Foundation on VxRail and vvd for VMware Validated Designs, depending on the value chosen the appliance on first boot will install and configured the correct user interface.\nMultiple software bundles. In this release we have broken down iso bundle from a single 24GB file into multiple files. Contained within the VMware Cloud Builder OVA itself we have the sddc-foundation-bundle.x.x.x.x-xxxxxxxx.iso file which contains the binaries for the foundation layer including ESXi, vCenter, NSX and SDDC Manager. This is used by both VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware Validated Designs. The sddc-vrealize-bundle.x.x.x.x-xxxxxxxx.iso file is downloaded separately and contains the binaries for the vRealize Suite and is used by the VMware Validated Designs workflows.

In this post I will provide some background history and provide a bit of detail as to exactly what VMware Cloud Builder is and how it can be used.\nHistory Nearly four years ago, the ISBU embarked on a journey to develop a blueprint architecture for implementing a Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) and thus VMware Validated Designs were born. As you can imagine the work involved to validate the blueprint required the team to repeatedly tear down and build up environments to validate operationally and develop the documentation we have come to know and love, an idea of using automation was hatched and a small team of developers set about building a tool that became known internally as VVD Deployment Toolkit (DTK). A short time after its inception whilst working for another team outside of the ISBU I convinced my now manager to release the DTK to VMware Professional Services and for around two and half years they used the DTK to implement many VMware Validated Design deployments delivering faster time-to-value for our customers. About twelve months ago we took the decision to migrate all of the automation from DTK over into the same orchestration engine that is used by VMware Cloud Foundation and with the release of VMware Validated Design v4.3 we replaced DTK with VMware Cloud Builder however this continued to be only made available for internal ISBU use and VMware Professional Services only until now….\nWhat is VMware Cloud Builder? VMware Cloud Builder is an appliance distributed as an Open Virtualization Appliance (OVA) package that manages the orchestration of deployment and configuration of an SDDC platform that adheres to the blueprint set out by VMware Validated Designs. What this means is that it’s not a general-purpose automation tool for just laying down some VMware products but rather it configures them based on the VMware Validated Design chosen. Once the appliance has been deployed you upload the VMware Validated Design Software Bundle which is a single ISO file containing all the VMware product binaries defined for that release of the VMware Validated Design, upload signed-certificates generated using CertGen (see KB 2146215) run the reconfigure.sh script to mount the ISO and perform some configuration steps and your all set. Only requirement is that you own the licenses for each component that is deployed and that you need to gather the deployment configuration using the relevant Deployment Parameters XLS file for the architecture, these can be download from my.vmware.com or directly from the VMware Cloud Builder appliance once deployed.\nThe VMware Validated Design Software Bundle contains the following VMware software binaries:\nVMware ESXi VMware vCenter Server VMware NSX for vSphere VMware vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager VMware vRealize Operations Manager Management Packs for vRealize Operations Manager VMware vRealize Log Insight Content Packs for vRealize Log Insight VMware vRealize Automation VMware vRealize Business for Cloud VMware Site Recovery Manager VMware vSphere Replication What architectures can I deploy with VMware Cloud Builder? The VMware Validated Designs support a number of different architectures that have been developed to support different customer profiles. VMware Cloud Builder has been developed to be flexible enough to handle these different architectures and today supports the following:\nVMware Validated Design for Software-Defined Data Center – Region A VMware Validated Design for Software-Defined Data Center – Region B VMware Validated Design for Management and Workload Consolidation Home Page - VMware Cloud Builder User Interface\nWhat is the Deployment Parameters XLS File? When deploying the VMware Validated Designs using VMware Cloud Builder we provide levels of flexibility in that we can configure using customer defined naming conventions for objects such as hostnames, datacenters, clusters, datastores as well as allocation of IP addresses and networks. This customer specific information is captured in the excel workbook known as the Deployment Parameters XLS file.\nThe process of gathering this custom configuration involves siting down and populating the relevant Deployment Parameters XLS file. The configuration gathering process has been developed using an excel workbook as it provides the most flexible method for data gathering due to its portability and ease of updates.\nThe Deployment Parameters XLS file consists of a number of worksheets or tabs, each defined to collect specific types of data typically aligned with the discussions you have during the data gathering process with the target audiences such as roles and responsibilities within the organization.\nThe Deployment Parameters XLS file contains the following worksheets:\nPrerequisites Checklist – contains details concerning the preparation phase of the deployment and used to track the status of the preparation work. Management Workloads – from a data gathering stand-point used to capture the license keys used by each VMware solution. Also contains a footprint breakdown of all the management component virtual machines deployed as part of the architecture for reference. Users and Groups – captures service accounts and groups in Active Directory that are required by the deployment as well as all the passwords that are used. Hosts and Networks – captures all VLAN configuration details pertaining to the environment and the configuration details for each ESXi host. Deployment Parameters – captures product specific configuration options exposed for customization including hostnames, IP address, Active Directory, DNS and NTP configuration, vCenter objects and more. vRA Configuration – captures configuration details that should be applied to a tenant that is created within vRealize Automation. Run Parameters – provides the ability to manipulate how VMware Cloud Builder implements the SDDC platform such as instructing it to not use VSAN or not deploying a specific product. CertConfig – auto populated worksheet that pulls the required details for using the CertConfig utility to automate the creation of the configuration files used by CertGen to generate the signed certificates across all VMware solutions. Microsoft Excel - Deployment Parameter Workbook How does this all come together? Now we have a better understanding of VMware Cloud Builder and the supporting files that are available for download from my.vmware.com let’s describe the end-to-end workflow. The general flow is as follows:\nPrepare the environment by performing all the prerequisites as documented in the Deployment Guides: Prepare ESXi hosts Prepare UMDS virtual machine Prepare vRealize Automation IaaS Master VM Prepare SQL Server for vRealize Automation Prepare Site Recovery Manager Generate signed certificates Populate the Deployment Parameters XLS file. Download and deploy the VMware Cloud Builder appliance Upload the software bundle Upload the signed certificates Deploy the Software-Defined Data Center Generate the JSON file Audit the deployment parameters and target environment Deploy the Software-Defined Data Center Perform manual post-deployment procedures As you can see VMware Cloud Builder drastically reduces the procedures for deploying an SDDC platform allowing you to focus more of your time on delivering business benefits.\nConclusion With the release of VMware Cloud Builder, customers have a new tool to automate the deployment of a VMware Validated Design.

With the introduction of v5.2, VMware provided enhanced integration so that vCAC would correctly discover the relationship between the primary and recovery virtual machines.\nThese enhancements consisted of what could be considered minor modifications, albeit minor they were fundamental to ensuring that vCenter Site Recovery Manager (SRM) could successfully be implemented to the deliver disaster recovery of virtual machines managed by vCAC. So What’s Changed? When a virtual machine is protected by SRM a ‘Managed Object Reference ID’ or ‘MoRefID’ is created against the virtual machine record in the vCenter Server database.\nPrior to SRM v5.5 a single virtual machine property was created on the placeholder virtual machine object in the recovery site vCenter Server database called ‘ManagedBy:SRM,placeholderVM’, but vCAC did not inspect this value and so would attempt to add a second duplicate entry into its database, with the introduction of vCAC 5.2 when a data collection is run vCAC now ignores virtual machines with this value set to avoid this.\nIn addition to this SRM v5.5 introduced a second managed by property value which is placed on the virtual machine vCenter Server database record called ‘ManagedBy:SRM,testVM’ when a test recovery process is performed and data collection is run at the recovery site vCAC inspects this value and also ignores the virtual machines with this set to avoid creating a duplicate entry in the vCAC database.\nWith the changes highlighted above, SRM v5.5 and later and vCAC 5.2 and later can now be implemented in tandem with full awareness of the other. However one limitation still remains when moving a virtual machine into recovery or reprotect mode, vCAC does not properly recognize the move. To successfully perform these machine operations and continue being able to manage the machine life cycle, you must use the ‘Change Reservation’ operation, however this is still a manual task.\nIntroducing the CloudClient In performing the investigation around the enhancements between SRM and vCAC above, and on uncovering the need for the manual change of reservation I spent some time with our Cloud Solution Engineering team discussing the need for finding a way to automate this step. They were already developing a tool called CloudClient, which is essentially a wrapper for our API’s allowing simple command line driven steps to be performed and suggested that this could be developed to support this use case.\nConclusion In order to achieve a fully functional integration between vCloud Automation Center (5.2 or later) and vCenter Site Recovery Manager adhere to the following design decisions:\nConfigure vCloud Automation Center with endpoints for both the protected and recovery sites. Perform a manual / automatic change reservation following a vCenter Site Recovery Manager planned or disaster migration. Frequently Asked Questions Q: When I fail over my VMs from the protected site to the recovery site what happens when I request the built in vCAC machine operations?\nA: Once you have performed a ‘Planned Migration’ or a ‘Disaster Recovery’ process, as long as you have changed the reservation within the vCAC Admin UI for the VM, machine operations will be performed in the normal way on the recovered VM.\nQ: What happens if I do not perform the Change Reservation step to a VM once I’ve completed a ‘Planned Migration’ or ‘Disaster Recovery’ process and I then attempt to perform the built in vCAC machine operations on the VM?\nA: Depending on which tasks you perform, some things are blocked by vCAC and you see an error message in the log “The method is disabled by ‘com.vmware.vcDR’” and some actions look like they are being processed but nothing happens. There are also a few actions, which are processed regardless of the VM failure scenario; these are Change Lease and Expiration Reminder.\nQ: What happens if I perform a reprovision action on a VM that is currently in a ‘Planned Migration’ or ‘Disaster Recovery’ state?\nA: VCAC will reprovision the VM in the normal manner, which is that the hostname and IP Address (if assigned through vCAC) will be maintained. However the SRM recovery plan will now fail if you attempt to reprotect the VM back to the protected site as the original object being managed is replaced. It’s recommended that for blueprints where SRM protection is a requirement that you disable the ‘Reprovision’ machine operation.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2015/vcac-dr/","section":"archive","tags":["vCAC"],"title":"vCloud Automation Center Disaster Recovery"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2014/","section":"archive","tags":["index"],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"Replacing the self-signed certificate of any product with a CA Signed alterative is common place and in most security conscious organizations mandatory, whilst working on an internal project recently I attempted to achieve just that for my vCenter Log Insight Virtual Appliance.\nThe official VMware documentation posted here, in my opinion its very light in content on this subject in fact it only really describes how to replace the certificate by browsing for the .pem file and restarting the appliance. I’m no expert when it comes to SSL Certificates and so the whole process was a little bit of trial an error but thought I would share the process with the community in an effort to save others some time.\nFirstly, there are some specific requirements which are well documented these are:\nThe certificate file must contain both a valid private key and a valid certificate chain. The private key is generated by the RSA or the DSA algorithm. The private key is not encrypted by a pass phrase. If the certificate is signed by a chain of other certificates, all other certificates are included in the certificate file that you plan to import. The private key and all the certificates that are included in the certificate file are PEM-encoded. Log Insight does not support DER-encoded certificates and private keys. The private key and all the certificates that are included in the certificate file are in the PEM format. Log Insight does not support certificates in the PFX, PKCS12, PKCS7, or other formats. For the whole process I will be using OpenSSL tool for Windows, which I have installed to the C:\\OpenSSL folder.\nI also use the C:\\Certs folder to store the files being generated throughout the process, if you have ever read one of the VMware KB articles this will look familiar.\nThe end to end process can be split into following three stages, which is pretty standard of all VMware products where you want to replace the self-signed certificate:\nStage 1 – Generating the .csr file Launch a command prompt and navigate into the OpenSSL directory. In the C:\\Certs folder, create a folder for your Log Insight certificate files (C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight) Open a text editor on the system where OpenSSL is installed. Create a configuration file vCenter Log Insight containing the following values (items in red must be altered to match your environment), save the file. 1[ req ] 2default_md = sha512 3default_bits = 2048 4default_keyfile = rui.key 5distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name 6encrypt_key = no 7prompt = no 8string_mask = nombstr 9req_extensions = v3_req 10[ v3_req ] 11basicConstraints = CA:false 12keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment 13extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth 14subjectAltName = DNS:hostname, IP: xx.xx.xx.xx, DNS: hostname.domain.com 15[ req_distinguished_name ] 16countryName = UK 17stateOrProvinceName = London 18localityName = London 190.organizationName = VMware 20organizationalUnitName = vCenter Log Insight 21commonName = hostname.domain.com Generate the .csr file by running the following command: 1openssl req -new -nodes -out C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.csr -keyout C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui-orig.key -config C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\openssl-loginsight.cfg Convert the orig_rui.key into RSA format by running the following command: 1openssl rsa -in C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui-orig.key -out C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.key Stage 2 – Obtaining the Certificate Now you have your .csr file, using the Microsoft Certificate Authority generate your certificate file. I've not documented the process as this is document in many other blog posts, for reference take a look at Derek Seaman's blog here.\nStage 3 – Installing the Certificate Launch a command prompt and navigate into the OpenSSL directory. Next we need to merge the certificate, private key and CA Chain by generating a .pfx file by issuing the following command: 1openssl pkcs12 -export -in C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.crt -inkey C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.key -certfile C:\\Certs\\Root64.cer -name rui -passout pass:testpassword -out C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.pfx Now we need to convert the .pfx file into the format that the vCenter Log Insight Appliance accepts which is a .pem file by issuing the following command: 1openssl pkcs12 -nodes -in C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.pfx -out C:\\Certs\\Log-Insight\\rui.pem Finally, you need to upload the rui.pem file into the appliance as per the VMware documentation.

I’ve not been able to find any SRM documentation that provides guidance on this but would suggest always using single quotes.\nCalling Linux Scripts Traditionally my clients have been 100% Windows shops, and when looking for guidance on SRM and calling scripts on Linux machines there is a distinct lack of discussions or information available. On a recent engagement this is exactly what I needed to do, but thanks to my colleague and SRM guru Lee Dilworth the answer is very simply use the following syntax:\n1/bin/sh /srm-scripts/callout.sh ","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2012/srm-commands/","section":"archive","tags":["SRM"],"title":"Running Commands with SRM 5.x "},{"body":"Question. According to this KB http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1026326, Windows VMs in vCloud Director need to be configured with DHCP to be able to join a Microsoft Active Directory domain. I have a VM with a static IP address. How do I get around this requirement?\nAnswer. The issue around DHCP is Microsoft-related and not VMware. The problem is that we rely on Sysprep to perform the customization and this is where the DHCP requirement comes in. As a workaround, we ran a script called SetupCommand.cmd which calls the netdom.exe command with the following syntax:\n1netdom.exe join %COMPUTERNAME% /Domain:vmware.com /OU:OU=vApp-VMs,DC=vmware,DC=com /Userd:???? /PasswordD:???? /Reboot To configure this: Before submitting the vApp to the catalog. Right click the VM and select Properties. Select the Guest OS Customization tab. Scroll down to the Customization Script sections and enter the command.

During the engagement we had various issues around how to implement the Dell components. Dell have produced a best practice document but some elements of the document are a little light on the ground. This blog is a collection of tested procedures that we followed to prove the solution.\nSetting up the Environment During our testing we setup the environment using the following steps:\nSet up the LUNs and replication using Compellent Enterprise Manager client. Save the restore points using Enterprise Manager client. This is a manual process that Dell talks about within their Best Practice guide and must be done after all major SRM events. Set up datastores in vSphere and present them to the appropriate hosts. Create a Protection Group(s) in SRM for the newly created datastores. Create a Recovery Plan(s) in SRM for the newly created datastores. Configure SRM debug logging in both Data Collectors to collect SRM information. (We did this step in order to capture detailed logging to provide Dell if required.) Confirmed that the SiteA SRA was talking to the remote data collector (hosted in SiteA) and the SiteB SRA was talking to primary data collector (hosted in SiteB, as per Compellent Best Practice. NOTE\nThis configuration is not 100% clear in the best practice document and we were provided conflicting information from Dell Support when we asked for verification, the document did not define Primary vs Remote Data Collectors and simply referred to Enterprise Manager in both sites.\nDefining the Failover Procedure We defined the following procedure to be run during a failover type of Disaster Recovery:\nRun the Recovery Plan, selecting Disaster Recovery as the recovery type. Save the restore points using Enterprise Manager client, ignoring the inactive ones flagged. NOTE\nThe Compellent Best Practice document says that these can be removed, but our testing showed that this created errors at the re-protect stage so we skipped this process.\nRe-protect (to reverse replication) Save the restore points using Enterprise Manager client. Defining the Failback Procedure We defined the following procedure to be run during a failback type of Disaster Planned Migration:\nRun the same Recovery Plan as used for the Failover procedure, selecting Planned Migration as the recovery type. Save the restore points using Enterprise Manager client, ignoring the inactive ones flagged. NOTE\nThe Compellent Best Practice document says that these can be removed, but our testing showed that this created errors at the re-protect stage so we skipped this process.\nRe-protect (to reverse replication). Save the restore points using Enterprise Manager client. Test Scenarios After defining the procedures we then carried out the following tests to verify the process.\nTest 1 - Both Compellent Enterprise Manager Data Collectors Running Ensuring both data collectors were up and running, the failover procedure was run for the following scenarios:\nDR from SiteB to SiteA, virtual machine TESTVM001, hosted on datastore SRMTest_1 DR from SiteA to SiteB, virtual machine TESTVM001, hosted on datastore SRMTest_2 Both failovers completed without error, so we then followed the failback procedure to bring everything back to where it started. Both failback procedures completed without error.\nTest 2 - Primary Data Collector Shut Down Shutting down the primary data collector hosted at SiteB, we simulated a failure of SiteB and then ran the following scenario:\nDR from SiteB to SiteA, virtual machine TESTVM001, hosted on datastore SRMTest_1 The failover completed successfully, but with a number of errors at the following stages of the recovery plan:\nPre-Synchronise Storage Prepare Protected Site FMs for Migration Synchronise Storage None of these errors were fatal but they did mean that a re-protect of the protection group could not be completed until they had been resolved. This meant running a second Recovery once the Primary data collector was back online, this then completed successfully and then allowed a re-protect to run.\nWith both data collectors online, the failback procedure was then run to bring everything back to where it started. This completed without error.\nTest 3 - Remote Data Collector Shut Down Shutting down the remote data collector hosted in SiteA, we simulated a failure of SiteA and then ran the following scenario:\nDR from SiteA to SiteB, virtual machine TESTVM002, hosted on datastore SRMTest_2 This failover completed successfully, but with the same non-critical errors as seen in test 2 along the way. Resolution was the same as test 2, bringing the remote data collector back online and then running a second Recovery. This completed successfully and allowed a re-protect to run.\nWith both data collectors online, the failback procedure was then run to bring everything back to where it started. This completed without error.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2012/srm-dell-compellent/","section":"archive","tags":["SRM","Dell Compellent"],"title":"SRM 5 \u0026 Dell Compellent Best Practice Procedures"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/hds-storage/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"HDS Storage"},{"body":"These are notes on how to setup Site Recovery Manager (SRM) with HDS Storage using a command control device.\nIf using a VM for the SRM server ensure the following are configured before attempting to install the SRM components:\nRDM presented to the SRM VM, attached, initialized, but not formatted or assigned a drive letter. Install Hitachi RAID-Manger/Command Control Interface to setup the HORCM service (Protected site HORCM0 \u0026amp; Recovery Site HORCM1). Configure the horcm0.conf and horcm1.conf files on the respective SRM Servers. Start HORCM service (you will need to alter the name of the run config file located in the C:\\HORCM\\Tools, to match the service name 0 or 1. Test connection locally using C:\\HORCM\\Tools\\pairdisplay –g GRP1 –l (for local check) and pairdisplay –g GRP1 –fcx (remote side check), alter GRP1 to match the Group defined in your HORCM.conf file. Frequently Asked Questions Q: Does the SRA work at an individual Hitachi LUN level or HUR (Hitachi Universal Replicator) journal level ?\nA: HUR keeps all LUN pairs in the JNL group in the same status so if the pairs are split for a failover, all pairs in the JNL groups are split. The SRA cannot override this behavior. To split a single LUN it must be in a JNL group without any other LUNs.\nQ: Can SRA do split/sync for just one LUN ?\nA: Yes, depending on the configuration of HORCM but this is possible. The HUR pairs need to be created as single LUN/JNL group.\nQ: If we have multiple LUN's in same journal does it split all LUN's at same time?\nA: Yes\nQ: Does the SRA start a reverse sync immediately (Reverse P-VOL and S-VOL) once the secondary site is brought up?\nA: With SRM 4, HUR / TC do horctakeover so replication is reversed and if possible resync is run in the reverse direction. This behavior was changed for SRM 5 to support the additional functions. SRM 5 will only split and reverse the replication but will not resync until the reverseReplication function is called.\nQ: Do we have to create a separate HUR journal for each LUN, for individual LUN failover/failback?\nA: A separate JNL Group.\nUseful links http://www.hds.com/assets/pdf/hitachi-storage-replication-adapter-software-vmware-vcenter-site-recovery-manager-deployment-guide.pdf http://www.hds.com/solutions/applications/vmware/download.html\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2012/srm-hds-storage/","section":"archive","tags":["SRM","HDS Storage"],"title":"Installing SRM with HDS Storage"},{"body":"I don’t know how much experience any of you have in delivering the Spring Source Pet Clinic application which can be used as a good sample application when delivering VMware vCloud Director (vCD). Based on recent experience I thought I would share:\nPet Clinic Spring Source Sample Application – The Pet Clinic application is a simple two VM application running on CentOS, it consist of a one VM running Tomcat and IMDB and a second VM running Apache Web Server.\nThe application is deployed using OVF import into a vSphere infrastructure and has the default configuration:\nVM Description Tomcat and IMDB Server Apache Server Hostname pc-vm-0-0 pc-vm-1-0 IP Address 192.168.2.101 192.168.2.100 Root Password napa napa Deploy the application and alter the IP Address as in my case to test the vSphere Infrastructure the following files need to be edited: Tomcat \u0026amp; Apache Server /etc/hosts (Alter the local host entry to match new IP Address) /etc/sysconfig/network (Alter the default gateway) /etc/sysconfig/networking/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 (Alter the servers IP Address) Apache Server Only /etc/httpd/conf.d/proxy.conf (Alter the IP Address of the DB Server) Deploying the Pet Clinic application and proving the web service. If you know much about vCD then you will be aware that there are many ways to hook up network connectivity, on a recent engagement I devised the following scenario’s to demonstrate to my customer, the key element I was looking to show was the ability to deploy multiple copies of the Pet Clinic application with the default system configuration detailed in my earlier post. Scenario One – Internal Organisation Network\nMultiple Pet Clinic vApps with a vApp Network of 192.168.2.x, each vApp Network is connected to the Internal Organisation Network through a vShield Edge with only NAT enabled, this allocates an IP address from the Org Network to each VM within the vApp.\nWindows management VM deployed directly on the Org Network, application proving is then done through vCD Remote Console onto this VM. A web connection is then made using a NATed IP to test the Pet Clinic application.\nScenario Two – External Organisation Network directly connected\nAdd a Windows VM into the Pet Clinic vApp and then deploy multiple Pet Clinic vApps with two vApp Networks. Network one using 192.168.2.x, and network two using 192.168.3.x. All three VMs are attached to the 192.168.2.0 network to allow the application to function as normal and the Windows VM has a second NIC set as the primary to the 192.168.3.x network.\nThe vApp is then connected to the External Organisation Network through a vShield Edge with NAT enabled on the 192.168.3.x network only. This provide the Windows VM with an IP address on the customers corporate LAN giving a direct RDP connection to the Windows VM in order to test and alter the application. The reason for creating the second vApp network was to limit the number of IPs needed when the vApp is powered as the customer could only provide 10 IPs.\nAdditional Management\nI additionally deployed a second management VM directly on the External Organisation Network and allocated two network cards one connected to it and the second attached to the Internal Organisation Network, this provided the added benefit of a jump box to allow access to the vApps deployed within the Internal Organisation. From the jump box the NATed IP of the Pet Clinic application can be used to access the application.\nAs I said before there are plenty of choices when configuring vCD and the above is just what I’ve set up recently to demonstrating the capabilities.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2011/pet-clinic/","section":"archive","tags":["vCloud Director"],"title":"Pet Clinic Application - vCloud PoC"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2011/","section":"archive","tags":["index"],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/vcd/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"vCD"},{"body":"In November 2011 VMware released the latest version of their free tool called vCloud Connector.
