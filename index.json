Each Validated Solution provides both UI and Infrastructure-as-code based procedures. The Infrastructure-as-code method is delivered through the use of a PowerShell module specifically created to support Validated Solutions called PowerValidatedSolutions, each UI based procedure has a PowerShell cmdlet equivalent that not only performs the operation but ensures pre and post validation checks are performed to provide robustness.\nIncluded with the PowerValidatedSolution PowerShell module which can be installed directly from the Microsoft PS Gallery there is a SampleScripts folder and contained within that a folder named iam which contains sample .ps1 script files. These sample scripts demonstrate linking multiple procedures into a single executable script using the Planning and Preparation Workbook as the input for all data.\nFor the Identity and Access Management solution this is broken down into three phases and therefore three scripts as follows:\nvSphere and SDDC Manager Workspace ONE Access NSX-T Data Center As already mentioned the scripts use the Planning and Preparation Workbook to obtain all the required inputs, this is the first step in the execution. The script checks that the path provided to the workbook is valid and then opens the workbook, reading the required information using named cells.\nOnce that step is complete it begins the process of executing each procedure based on the order of steps defined within the implementation guide.\nIn addition to providing the main cmdlets supporting the validated solution implementation procedures a number of cmdlets are included that provide supporting capabilities which are utilised by the scripts.\nStart-SetupLogFile - this cmdlet is used to configure a log file where the output of each step is logged. Write-LogMessage - this cmdlet is used to format the output of messages both to the console and log file. Debug-CatchWriter - this cmdlet is used to provide a consistent way of displaying exception errors should they occur. For each procedure executed by the script, the output is captured into variables and then redirected to the Write-LogMessage cmdlet for display to the console and log in a consistent way. There are three types of output messages :\nINFO - Used for informational messages and successful execution of a procedure. WARNING - Used when a procedure is skipped due to the process already being executed. ERROR - Used to display a failure along with the failure reason. Let’s now take a deeper look at the scripts.\nvSphere and SDDC Manager (iamConfigureVsphere.ps1) The iamConfigureVsphere.ps1 script automates all the procedures associated with ESXi, vCenter Server and SDDC Manager. This includes:\nAdd Identity Provider to vCenter Server. This adds Active Directory over LDAP or LDAPS to vCenter Server making Active Directory users and groups available to both vCenter Server and SDDC Manager for assigning access control. Assign Global Permissions. This assigns the vCenter Server Administrator and Read Only roles to corresponding groups in Active Directory. Assign Single Sign-On Permissions. This assigns the Single Sign-On Administrator role to a corresponding group in Active Directory. Configure vCenter Server Appliance password expiration policy. Configure Single Sign-On password and lockout polices. Assign SDDC Manager Roles. This assigns the Admin, Operator and Viewer roles to corresponding groups in Active Directory. Configure ESXi password and lockout polices. Execution of the iamConfigureVsphere.ps1 script is performed by using the following command:\n1.\\SampleScripts\\iam\\iamConfigureVsphere.ps1 -sddcManagerFqdn sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io -sddcManagerUser administrator@vsphere.local -sddcManagerPass VMw@re1! -workbook F:\\vvs\\PnP.xlsx -filePath F:\\vvs Workspace ONE Access (iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1) The iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1 script automates the deployment and configuration of Workspace ONE Access. This includes:\nCreating a Virtual Machine folder in vCenter Server. Deploying the Workspace ONE Access .ova. Performing the configuration of Workspace ONE Access: Initial configuration. This assigns the root, admin and sshuser credentials. Configure NTP settings. Configure SMTP server settings. Install a signed-certificate. Configure password policy. Add Identity Provider to Workspace ONE Access. This adds Active Directory over LDAP or LDAPS to Workspace ONE Access making Active Directory users and groups available. Assign Workspace ONE Access Permissions. This assigns the Super Admin, Directory Admin and Read Only Admin to corresponding groups in Active Directory. Create VM Group. This creates a VM Group in vCenter Server and assigns the Workspace ONE Access virtual machine to it. Execution of the iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1 script is performed by using the following command:\n1.\\SampleScripts\\iam\\iamConfigureWorkspaceOne.ps1 -sddcManagerFqdn sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io -sddcManagerUser administrator@vsphere.local -sddcManagerPass VMw@re1! -workbook F:\\vvs\\PnP.xlsx -filePath F:\\vvs NSX-T Data Center (iamConfigureNsx.ps1) The iamConfigureNsx.ps1 script automates the integration between the NSX Managers and Workspace ONE Access. Whilst it is possible to configure NSX-T Data Center with a direct connection to Active Directory over LDAP, the Identity and Access Management solution uses Workspace ONE Access which provides additional methods for connecting to authentication sources. This includes:\nEnable Integration between NSX Manager and Workspace ONE Access. Assign NSX-T Data Center Permissions. This assigns Enterprise Admin, Network Engineer and Auditor roles to corresponding groups in Active Directory for both the Management and Workload Domains. Configure Authentication Policies. This configure the authentication policies on the NSX Manager and NSX Edge Nodes for both the Management and Workload Domains. Create a custom role in vCenter Server. Assign Single Sign-On Permissions. This assigns the License Administration role to the NSX Manager service account used by SDDC Manager. Reduce vCenter Server Permissions. This reduces the permissions a specific vCenter Server service account has for other vCenter Servers within the Single Sign-On domain. Execution of the iamConfigureNsx.ps1 script is performed by using the following command:\n1.\\SampleScripts\\iam\\iamConfigureNsx.ps1 -sddcManagerFqdn sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io -sddcManagerUser administrator@vsphere.local -sddcManagerPass VMw@re1! -workbook F:\\vvs\\PnP.xlsx -filePath F:\\vvs After execution of these scripts in the order described above, and assuming that each step completed successfully your environment is fully configured based on the design and implementation procedures documented within the Identity and Access Management for VMware Cloud Foundation Validated Solution.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-post-01/","section":"post","tags":["API","PowerVCF","PowerShell"],"title":"End-to-End Automation of Identity and Access Management Validated Solution"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/powercli/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"PowerCLI"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/powershell/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"PowerShell"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/powervcf/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"PowerVCF"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/series/vvs-tip/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"VVS-Tip"},{"body":"Are you using the PowerValidatedSolutions PowerShell module?

For production environments its critical that this is changed before going live to ensure that you have the ability to recover in the event of a disaster.\nThe requirements of using an SFTP in my experience seem to fall through the gaps during most initial deployments and as a result it takes organizations some time to get all the requirements put in place. Such delays simply place a risk on the implementation until addressed.\nOne way to reduce this risk, and of course for use in a lab environment is to use VMware Cloud Builder as an alternative short term solution as it too has an SFTP service running, this can be acheived through a simple three step process:\nCreate a Backup Service Account on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance Create a Backup Folder on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance Re-Configure the Backup in SDDC Manager Create a Backup Service Account on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance First step is to create a local account on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance, this will be used as the service account and is supplied when re-configuring the backup configuation in SDDC Manager.\nConnect to the SDDC Manager Appliance using an SSH client such as Putty, and authenticate as admin.\nSwitch to root by entering the following command:\n1su Create the service account by entering the following command: 1useradd -m -p $(openssl passwd -1 VMw@re1!) svc-vcf-bck Create a Backup Folder on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance The next step is to create a target backup folder on the VMware Cloud Builder Appliance and assign the appropriate access to allow the service account to store backup jobs.\nCreate a new folder by entering the following command: 1mkdir /tmp/vcf-backups Configure access to the folder for the service account by entering the following command: 1chown svc-vcf-bck:users /tmp/vcf-backups Re-Configure the Backup in SDDC Manager And finally you re-configure the backup configuration to use the new SFTP target for backups, performing this task will trigger SDDC Manager to automatically reconfigure SDDC Manager and NSX-T Data Center.\nLogin to the SDDC Manager UI with a user assigned with the ADMIN role.\nUsing the navigation paine, select Administration \u0026gt; Backup.\nOn the Backup paine, select Site Settings and click Register External.\nEnter the values, and click Save. Setting Value Host FQDN or IP sfo-cb01.sfo.rainpole.io Port 22 Transfer Protocol SFTP Username svc-vcf-bck Password VMw@re1! Backup Directory /tmp/vcf-backups Confirm Fingerprint Selected Encryption Passphares VMw@re1!VMw@re1! On the Confirm your changes to backup settings dialog, click Confirm. Your details will be saved and the Configure Backup of VCF Components (SDDC Manager and NSX Managers) task will start.

If you didn't see my initial blog article on VMware Cloud Builder v1.0 you can find it here https://vmland.blogspot.com/2019/01/introducing-vmware-cloud-builder.html.\nWhat's New\nSupports for VMware Cloud Foundation 3.7 and VMware Validated Design 5.0.1 using the same OVA. With the release of VMware Cloud Builder v2.0 the biggest change is that we now support the automated deployment of both VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware Validated Designs using the same base OVA. When you deploy the OVA you pass a SKU value of vcf for VMware Cloud Foundation, vcf-vxrail for VMware Cloud Foundation on VxRail and vvd for VMware Validated Designs, depending on the value chosen the appliance on first boot will install and configured the correct user interface.\nMultiple software bundles. In this release we have broken down iso bundle from a single 24GB file into multiple files.\nContained within the VMware Cloud Builder OVA itself we have the sddc-foundation-bundle.x.x.x.x-xxxxxxxx.iso file which contains the binaries for the foundation layer including ESXi, vCenter, NSX and SDDC Manager. This is used by both VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware Validated Designs The sddc-vrealize-bundle.x.x.x.x-xxxxxxxx.iso file is downloaded separately and contains the binaries for the vRealize Suite and is used by the VMware Validated Designs workflows. The sddc-dr-bundle.x.x.x.x-xxxxxxxx.iso file is also downloaded separately and contains the binaries for Site Recovery Manager and vSphere Replication.\nUseful Links VMware Cloud Foundation 3.7 Release Notes VMware Cloud Foundation 3.7.0 Downloads VMware Validated Design for Software-Defined Data Center 5.0.1 Release Notes VMware Validated Design 5.0.1 Downloads\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2016-2020/cb-whats-new-v2/","section":"archive","tags":["Cloud Builder"],"title":"VMware Cloud Builder - Logging and Log Collection"},{"body":"I work at VMware in the UK as a Senior Staff Solution Architect within the Cloud Infrastructure Business Group (CIBG) which is a global team responsible for the solution design for VMware Cloud Foundation, VMware Validated Solutions.

According to this KB http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1026326, Windows VMs in vCloud Director need to be configured with DHCP to be able to join a Microsoft Active Directory domain. I have a VM with a static IP address. How do I get around this requirement?\nAnswer. The issue around DHCP is Microsoft-related and not VMware. The problem is that we rely on Sysprep to perform the customization and this is where the DHCP requirement comes in. As a workaround, we ran a script called SetupCommand.cmd which calls the netdom.exe command with the following syntax:\n1netdom.exe join %COMPUTERNAME% /Domain:vmware.com /OU:OU=vApp-VMs,DC=vmware,DC=com /Userd:???? /PasswordD:???? /Reboot To configure this: Before submitting the vApp to the catalog. Right click the VM and select Properties. Select the Guest OS Customization tab. Scroll down to the Customization Script sections and enter the command.

Install Hitachi RAID-Manger/Command Control Interface to setup the HORCM service (Protected site HORCM0 \u0026amp; Recovery Site HORCM1). Configure the horcm0.conf and horcm1.conf files on the respective SRM Servers. Start HORCM service (you will need to alter the name of the run config file located in the C:\\HORCM\\Tools, to match the service name 0 or 1. Test connection locally using C:\\HORCM\\Tools\\pairdisplay –g GRP1 –l (for local check) and pairdisplay –g GRP1 –fcx (remote side check), alter GRP1 to match the Group defined in your HORCM.conf file. FAQ:\nDoes the SRA work at an individual Hitachi LUN level or HUR (Hitachi Universal Replicator) journal level ? Answer: HUR keeps all LUN pairs in the JNL group in the same status so if the pairs are split for a failover, all pairs in the JNL groups are split. The SRA cannot override this behavior. To split a single LUN it must be in a JNL group without any other LUNs.\nCan SRA do split/sync for just one LUN ? Answer: Yes, depending on the configuration of HORCM but this is possible. The HUR pairs need to be created as single LUN/JNL group.\nIf we have multiple LUN's in same journal does it split all LUN's at same time? Answer: Yes\nDoes the SRA start a reverse sync immediately (Reverse P-VOL and S-VOL) once the secondary site is brought up? Answer: With SRM 4, HUR / TC do horctakeover so replication is reversed and if possible resync is run in the reverse direction. This behavior was changed for SRM 5 to support the additional functions. SRM 5 will only split and reverse the replication but will not resync until the reverseReplication function is called.\nDo we have to create a separate HUR journal for each LUN, for individual LUN failover/failback? Answer: A separate JNL Group.\nUseful links: http://www.hds.com/assets/pdf/hitachi-storage-replication-adapter-software-vmware-vcenter-site-recovery-manager-deployment-guide.pdf http://www.hds.com/solutions/applications/vmware/download.html\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2011-2015/srm-hds-storage/","section":"archive","tags":["Linux"],"title":"Installing SRM with HDS Storage"},{"body":"","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/tags/linux/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Linux"},{"body":"I don’t know how much experience any of you have in delivering the Spring Source Pet Clinic application which can be used as a good sample application when delivering vCloud Director. Based on recent experience I thought I would share:\nPet Clinic Spring Source Sample Application – The Pet Clinic application is a simple two VM application running on CentOS, it consist of a one VM running Tomcat and IMDB and a second VM running Apache Web Server.\nThe application is deployed using OVF import into a vSphere infrastructure and has the default configuration:\nVM Description Tomcat and IMDB Server Apache Server Hostname pc-vm-0-0 pc-vm-1-0 IP Address 192.168.2.101 192.168.2.100 Root Password napa napa Deploy the application and alter the IP Address as in my case to test the vSphere Infrastructure the following files need to be edited: Tomcat \u0026amp; Apache Server /etc/hosts (Alter the local host entry to match new IP Address) /etc/sysconfig/network (Alter the default gateway) /etc/sysconfig/networking/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 (Alter the servers IP Address) Apache Server Only /etc/httpd/conf.d/proxy.conf (Alter the IP Address of the DB Server) Deploying the Pet Clinic application and proving the web service. If you know much about vCD then you will be aware that there are many ways to hook up network connectivity, on a recent engagement I devised the following scenario’s to demonstrate to my customer, the key element I was looking to show was the ability to deploy multiple copies of the Pet Clinic application with the default system configuration detailed in my earlier post. Scenario One – Internal Organisation Network\nMultiple Pet Clinic vApps with a vApp Network of 192.168.2.x, each vApp Network is connected to the Internal Organisation Network through a vShield Edge with only NAT enabled, this allocates an IP address from the Org Network to each VM within the vApp.\nWindows management VM deployed directly on the Org Network, application proving is then done through vCD Remote Console onto this VM. A web connection is then made using a NATed IP to test the Pet Clinic application.\nScenario Two – External Organisation Network directly connected\nAdd a Windows VM into the Pet Clinic vApp and then deploy multiple Pet Clinic vApps with two vApp Networks. Network one using 192.168.2.x, and network two using 192.168.3.x. All three VMs are attached to the 192.168.2.0 network to allow the application to function as normal and the Windows VM has a second NIC set as the primary to the 192.168.3.x network.\nThe vApp is then connected to the External Organisation Network through a vShield Edge with NAT enabled on the 192.168.3.x network only. This provide the Windows VM with an IP address on the customers corporate LAN giving a direct RDP connection to the Windows VM in order to test and alter the application. The reason for creating the second vApp network was to limit the number of IPs needed when the vApp is powered as the customer could only provide 10 IPs.\nAdditional Management\nI additionally deployed a second management VM directly on the External Organisation Network and allocated two network cards one connected to it and the second attached to the Internal Organisation Network, this provided the added benefit of a jump box to allow access to the vApps deployed within the Internal Organisation. From the jump box the NATed IP of the Pet Clinic application can be used to access the application.\nAs I said before there are plenty of choices when configuring vCD and the above is just what I’ve set up recently to demonstrating the capabilities.\n","link":"http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/archive/2011-2015/pet-clinic/","section":"archive","tags":["vCloud Director"],"title":"Pet Clinic Application - vCloud PoC"},{"body":"In November 2011 VMware released the latest version of their free tool called vCloud Connector.
