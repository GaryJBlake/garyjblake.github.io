By default when VMware Cloud Foundation is deployed, SDDC Manager and NSX-T Data Center are configured to use an SFTP service running locally on the SDDC Manager Appliance. For production environments its critical that this is changed before going live to ensure that you have the ability to recover in the event of a disaster.
The requirements of using an SFTP in my experience seem to fall through the gaps during most initial deployments and as a result it takes organizations some time to get all the requirements put in place.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Builder Validation: SSL Certificate common name doesn’t match ESXi FQDN</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-cb-esxi-certs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-cb-esxi-certs/</guid><description>
On February 9th VMware released VMware Cloud Foundation 4.2, and with it a number of new security enhancements, one of which means that each ESXi host used for either a Management Domain or Workload Domain now requires the self-signed certificate for the ESXi host to have its common name matching the real FQDN assigned to the host.
Failure to follow the procedure will result in the validation task failing with the error message: 'SSL Certificate common name doesn’t match ESXi FQDN'.</description></item></channel></rss>
