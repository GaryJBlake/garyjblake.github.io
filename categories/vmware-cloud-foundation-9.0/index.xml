When the auto-generate passwords options is selected within the VCF Installer UI, there maybe a scenario where you need to perform troubleshooting and a need to login to one of the underlying component appliances. Of course this is only possible if you know the passwords that were auto-generated, its relatively simple to retrieve the JSON specification used to perform the implementation from the VCF Installer appliance itself.
The following procedure demonstrates how you can retrieve a specific section of the JSON specification.</description></item><item><title>Adjusting ESX Certificate Key Size in VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf-90/vcf-90-esx-certificate-keysize/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf-90/vcf-90-esx-certificate-keysize/</guid><description>
If you have VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 deployed and you have been using the Certificate Management capability of Fleet Management you may have noticed that with the exception of ESX you're able to use a certificate key size greater than 2048 for components such as VCF Operations, VCF Automation, SDDC Manager, vCenter and NSX Manager whereas ESX is limited to 2048.
This was recently raised by one of my colleagues in the field, where their customer had a minimum requirement of 3072.</description></item><item><title>Using VMware.Sdk.Srm: Commands for VMware Live Site Recovery in PowerCLI</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf-90/vcf-90-powercli-srm-cmdlets/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf-90/vcf-90-powercli-srm-cmdlets/</guid><description>
