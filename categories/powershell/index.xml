This is the final part of my blog series in which I talk about automating the VMware Cloud Foundation upgrade process. At this point you should have completed the following tasks:
Downloaded All Bundles Initial Health Check SDDC Manager Upgrade SDDC Manager Configuration Drift Update We are now ready to begin the process of upgrading the individual components within a Workload Domain, for this we must first start with the Management Domain before we can carry out any component upgrades of a VI Workload Domain.</description></item><item><title>Automating VCF Upgrade - SDDC Manager</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-03/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-03/</guid><description>
This is part three of a four part blog series in which I talk about automating the VMware Cloud Foundation upgrade process. If you have been following the series so far then you will have your bundles downloaded, and performed various health checks to confirm that all is well and will now be ready to start the upgrade process.
Upgrading VMware Cloud Foundation is a multi-stage process, this post will focus on upgrading SDDC Manager which in itself involves two step:</description></item><item><title>Automating VCF Upgrade - Perform Health Checks</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-02/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-02/</guid><description>
This is part two of a four part blog series in which I talk about automating the VMware Cloud Foundation upgrade process. In part one we discussed downloading the bundles to SDDC Manager to prepare the system for the upgrade process, in this post we discuss performing the upgrade pre-checks.
Ensuring your VMware Cloud Foundation instance is healthy prior to starting an upgrade is critical to a successful upgrade, SDDC Manager itself has a pre-check process which is executed on a per workload domain basis.</description></item><item><title>Automating the Upgrade of VMware Cloud Foundation with APIs/PowerVCF/PowerShell</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade/</guid><description>

A couple of years ago I wrote a series of blogs (see here) which discussed the process of automating the deployment procedures of VMware Cloud Foundation using the Public APIs, in this new series we will take a look at how we can automate the steps involved in upgrading VMware Cloud Foundation from one release to another.
But before we can begin performing any actual upgrade steps we must carry out some prerequisites which include:</description></item><item><title>Automating VCF Upgrade - Download Release Bundles</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-01/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-01/</guid><description>
In order to upgrade VMware Cloud Foundation you must first download the upgrade bundles, I recently wrote a blog Automating the Download of VCF Bundles for a Release on this topic which I shared a script vcfBundleDownload.ps1 which can be downloaded from GitHub which we will utilize as part of the procedure here. The script takes a JSON as input where we define the bundle IDs for download but as part of this post I will share a way to automate that part too.</description></item></channel></rss>
