A couple of years ago I wrote a series of blogs (see here) which discussed the process of automating the deployment procedures of VMware Cloud Foundation using the Public APIs, in this new series we will take a look at how we can automate the steps involved in upgrading VMware Cloud Foundation from one release to another.
But before we can begin performing any actual upgrade steps we must carry out some prerequisites which include:</description></item><item><title>Automating VCF Upgrade - Download Release Bundles</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-01/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-01/</guid><description>
In order to upgrade VMware Cloud Foundation you must first download the upgrade bundles, I recently wrote a blog Automating the Download of VCF Bundles for a Release on this topic which I shared a script vcfBundleDownload.ps1 which can be downloaded from GitHub which we will utilize as part of the procedure here. The script takes a JSON as input where we define the bundle IDs for download but as part of this post I will share a way to automate that part too.</description></item><item><title>Cleaning Up VCF-password* Accounts from vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-vrslcm-vcf-password/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-vrslcm-vcf-password/</guid><description>
If you have had VMware Cloud Foundation and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager deployed within your infrastructure for some time you may have noticed in the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Password Locker that there are many passwords called VCF-password-&amp;lt; guid &amp;gt;. This is an internal service account used by vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager to make vCenter Server API calls and is rotated automatically by SDDC Manager.
This duplication of accounts happens due to the fact that there is no way to update the existing record and so SDDC Manager has to create a new account when the rotation process occurs.</description></item><item><title>Remove vRealize Log Insight Agent from SDDC Manager</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-remove-liagent/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-remove-liagent/</guid><description>
If you have ever wanted to remove the vRealize Log Insight from VMware Cloud Foundation you may have skipped the step to uninstall the vRealize Log Insight Linux Agent from SDDC Manager, whilst the process is documented in the VMware documentation for vRealize Log Insight under Uninstall the Log Insight Linux Agent RPM package the procedure does not help you establish the version installed so here is a quick blog to tie all the information together.</description></item><item><title>Introducing a PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Password Management</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-password-management/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-password-management/</guid><description>
Background In January 2023 through the VMware Validated Solution programme we released both documentation and PowerShell cmdlets to help with the configuration of password policies across the VMware Cloud Foundation platform, enabling our customers to report and configure the password expiration, password complexity, and account lockout policies at scale.
The positive feedback received to date has blown us away and so last month during one of our planning sessions we discussed the merits for spinning out the cmdlets into their own dedicated open-source PowerShell module, during that discussion it was agreed that this would provide us and our customers the following benefits:</description></item><item><title>PowerVCF v2.3.0 - General Availability</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-230/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-230/</guid><description>

This week we released a new VMware Fling, VMware Cloud Foundation Configuration File Generator which is a containerized web application developed to replace the Deployment Parameter Workbook used for performing the VMware Cloud Foundation Bring-up of the Management Domain.
VMware Cloud Builder supports providing either the Deployment Parameter Workbook an Excel workbook which is then converted into JSON format and used by the Bring-up engine or simply providing the JSON file already created.</description></item><item><title>Generating Health Reports for VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-cloud-reporting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-cloud-reporting/</guid><description>
VMware Cloud Foundation is an advanced hybrid cloud platform that provides a complete set of software-defined services for compute, storage, networking, security and cloud management to run enterprise apps.
By definition this means that VMware Cloud Foundation consists of a number products from across the VMware portfolio but how do you know your platform is healthy? The obvious answer is to include products such as vRealize Operations or vRealize Log Insight but what if there was a simpler way to gain some insights into the health without the need to implement and manage additional components?</description></item><item><title>Configure Password Expiration Policy for NSX Manager/Edge Nodes for a VMware Cloud Foundation Instance</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-nsxt-password-expiration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-nsxt-password-expiration/</guid><description>
With the release of VMware Cloud Foundation 4.5.0 a welcome enhancement to Password Management comes the notification capability, with this new feature we have introduced firstly a new banner that appears in the SDDC Manager UI when an account is identified as disconnected either as a result of the password expiring or the component going offline and secondly a new widget that notifies you when passwords are due to expire. Getting early visibility that passwords are due to expire has a significant impact on the workload of a Site Resiliency Engineer (SRE) in that it allows them to plan for password rotation operations ahead of time rather than dealing with a reactive situation where a password has actually expired.</description></item><item><title>Fixing Expired Passwords on Workspace ONE Access</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-wsa-passwords/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-wsa-passwords/</guid><description>
By default Workspace ONE Access passwords (root, sshuser) are set to expire after 60 days. Unless you rotate passwords on regular basis you may have overlooked this default configuration and suddenly find yourself locked out of being able to perform management tasks.
VMware Cloud Foundation provides the ability to perform scheduled or manual password rotations something to consider looking into from a day-to-day operational process but if your passwords have already expired this won't help as the VMware Cloud Foundation password rotation workflow can no longer authenticate.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation and vRealize Suite Flexibility</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-vrealize-flexibility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-vrealize-flexibility/</guid><description>
With the release of VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.0, VMware removed a number of the vRealize Suite of products from the Bill of Materials (BoM) with the intent of providing customers more flexibility. For more details refer to Flexible vRealize Suite product upgrades of the What's New section of the release notes.
Whilst this is great news for our customers, it has led to a bit of confusion.

Ever been in the situation where your licenses assigned in VMware Cloud Foundation are due to expire, well whilst doing some work this week in the lab I noticed that some of mine were coming up for expiration, which got me wondering what the process was to remedy. If you have been in this situation, you probably like me started by checking out the License Management section of the VMware Cloud Foundation Administration Guide and like me ended up being disappointed to find that it only covers the following topics:</description></item><item><title>Fixing Expired Passwords on NSX Manager and Edge Nodes</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-nsxt-passwords/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-nsxt-passwords/</guid><description>
By default NSX-T Data Center passwords (root, admin and audit) on the NSX Manager and NSX Edge nodes are set to expire after 90 days. Unless you rotate passwords on regular basis you may have overlooked this default configuration and suddenly find yourself locked out of being able to perform management tasks.
Firstly in more recent releases, VMware Cloud Foundation provides the ability to perform scheduled or manual password rotations something to consider looking into from a day-to-day operational process but if your passwords have already expired all bets are off as the VMware Cloud Foundation password rotation workflow can no longer authenticate.</description></item><item><title>Automating the Download of VCF Bundles for a Release</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-bundle-download/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-bundle-download/</guid><description>

By default when VMware Cloud Foundation is deployed, SDDC Manager and NSX-T Data Center are configured to use an SFTP service running locally on the SDDC Manager Appliance. For production environments its critical that this is changed before going live to ensure that you have the ability to recover in the event of a disaster.
The requirements of using an SFTP in my experience seem to fall through the gaps during most initial deployments and as a result it takes organizations some time to get all the requirements put in place.</description></item><item><title>PowerVCF v2.1.3 - General Availability</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-213/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-213/</guid><description>

Background For those of you who are not familiar with VMware Cloud Builder its a virtual appliance that is shipped as part of VMware Cloud Foundation. It's primary goal is to bootstrap the deployment and configuration of the Management Domain which includes ESXi, vCenter Server, NSX-T Data Center and SDDC Manager.
VMware Cloud Builder was first released to support the automated deployment of the VMware Validated Design 5.0 and as part of that development work the team started with a virtual appliance known as Cloud VM which was used by Service Providers to deploy a different version of VMware Cloud Foundation back in the 2.</description></item><item><title>PowerVCF v2.1.2 - General Availability</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-212/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-212/</guid><description>

On February 9th VMware released VMware Cloud Foundation 4.2, and with it a number of new security enhancements, one of which means that each ESXi host used for either a Management Domain or Workload Domain now requires the self-signed certificate for the ESXi host to have its common name matching the real FQDN assigned to the host.
Failure to follow the procedure will result in the validation task failing with the error message: 'SSL Certificate common name doesn’t match ESXi FQDN'.</description></item><item><title>PowerVCF v2.1.1 - General Availability</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-211/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-211/</guid><description>

If you follow my posts you will know that in January I posted about the release of PowerVCF which is a PowerShell based CLI that exposes the public APIs of VMware Cloud Foundation to be easily consumed by VI Admins (see Introducing PowerVCF – Power to VI Admins).
As mentioned before PowerVCF is a open source project and the team has been working hard in their spare time to continue to evolve the cmdlets it offers.</description></item><item><title>Introducing PowerVCF - Power to VI Admins</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-intro/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-intro/</guid><description>
Back in December I was chatting with my good friend and colleague Brian O'Connell about automating a bunch of post configuration tasks within VMware Cloud Foundation using the new Public APIs, and it was during that conversation he shared a pet project he had been working on called PowerVCF, the idea behind PowerVCF being a way to allow VI Admin's to easily consume the new public APIs we began shipping with VMware Cloud Foundation much in the same way PowerNSX and PowerVRA come about.</description></item></channel></rss>
