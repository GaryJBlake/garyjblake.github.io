If your not already familiar with the Intelligent Operations Management for VMware Cloud Foundation validated solution it’s primary purpose is to provide operations monitoring, analytics and reporting for VMware Cloud Foundation infrastructure components.
This is achieved through the deployment of vRealize Operations and the configuration of it's management packs to collect data from ESXi, vCenter Server, NSX-T Data Center, SDDC Manager, vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, and Workspace ONE Access.
The roles and personas documented (here) should be considered as a minimum requirement when implementing the Intelligent Operations Management validated solution but there is nothing stopping customers adding more granular roles where possible or even personas that better align with their own organizations roles and responsibilities.</description></item></channel></rss>
