Since the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom there has been a significant amount of effort behind the scenes to consolidate systems, processes and portals, as a result of this work a couple of key areas have been affected that impact VMware Validated Solutions. If as a result you have been struggling to find the content then read on!

Last Updated 08-Oct-2024 VMware Validated Solutions are byte sized solutions developed to extend the foundational capabilities of VMware Cloud Foundation, for background reading see my previous post here. Over time the team intends to add incremental value where opportunities arise and I plan to share as much detail as I can with each new update using my What's New for VMware Validated Solutions series of blog posts. I've decided to create this single landing page where I will provide a consolidated list of links to the relevant Editions of this series so you can bookmark this single page for ease of use.</description></item><item><title>What's New for VMware Validated Solutions - Edition #26 (October 2024)</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-26/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-26/</guid><description>

Background When we started on the VMware Validated Solution journey nearly three years ago, one of the main criteria we agreed on was to provide our customers with an automated way to deploy and configure whatever was defined within a solution. During the process we also did some analysis on tooling and came to the decision that we would use PowerShell as our automation tool of choice based on the flexibility it gave us.</description></item><item><title>What's New for VMware Validated Solutions - Edition #24 (May 2024)</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-24/</guid><description>

VMware Cloud Foundation has come a long way in recent years, one of the biggest developments introduced a few releases back centred around the relaxation of a strict Bill of Materials (BoM) as it pertained to the vRealize Suite ( see here ), the intent being to enable our customers to update the underlying vRealize Suite components faster to adopt new features.
One of the largest and most complex challenges of any integrated software stack is ensuring that the latest and greatest products and features are available to our customers, this is especially so at VMware as we have a number of business groups who own the underlying products consumed by VMware Cloud Foundation.</description></item><item><title>Configure Password Policies for VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-password-policy-config/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-password-policy-config/</guid><description>
In a recent blog ( see here ) I provided an overview of Password Policy Configuration for VMware Cloud Foundation, in this blog we will take a deep dive on using Start-PasswordPolicyConfig which actually performs the configuration of all password policies across the VMware Cloud Foundation instance.
The Start-PasswordPolicyConfig cmdlet is part of the PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Password Management and provides the ability to automate the configuration of password policies using the provided configuration JSON for the following components:</description></item><item><title>Generating Password Policy Reports for VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-password-policy-reports/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-password-policy-reports/</guid><description>

In a recent blog ( see here ) I provided an overview of Password Policy Configuration for VMware Cloud Foundation, in this blog we will take a deep dive on using Invoke-PasswordPolicyManager to generate the password policy reports.
The Invoke-PasswordPolicyManager cmdlet is part of the PowerShell Module for VMware Cloud Foundation Password Management and provides the ability to generate two types of HTML reports:
An HTML report showing the current configuration for password expiration, password complexity and account lockout for each component.</description></item><item><title>Password Policy Configuration for VMware Cloud Foundation Overview</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-password-policy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-password-policy/</guid><description>

Password Policy Configuration may not be that important to some but for security teams it’s critical for ensuring their organization is protected. If you have ever looked deep into this area when it comes to VMware Cloud Foundation and the components involved you will quickly realize that unfortunately VMware today does not make things easy for our customers. We have:
lack of consistency with default values lack of consistency with common parameters lack of consistency with API methods lack of consistency with terminology and language This is why with the January Update to VMware Validated Solutions ( see here ) we have spent a significant amount of time reviewing and rewriting all aspects of our content as it relates to Password Policy Configuration.</description></item></channel></rss>
