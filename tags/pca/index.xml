If your not already familiar with the Private Cloud Automation for VMware Cloud Foundation validated solution it’s primary purpose is to implement a modern cloud automation platform that delivers self-service automation, DevOps for infrastructure, and orchestration.
This is achieved through the deployment of vRealize Automation and the integration with one of more VMware Cloud Foundation instances.
