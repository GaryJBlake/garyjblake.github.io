With the release of VMware Cloud Foundation 4.5.0 a welcome enhancement to Password Management comes the notification capability, with this new feature we have introduced firstly a new banner that appears in the SDDC Manager UI when an account is identified as disconnected either as a result of the password expiring or the component going offline and secondly a new widget that notifies you when passwords are due to expire. Getting early visibility that passwords are due to expire has a significant impact on the workload of a Site Resiliency Engineer (SRE) in that it allows them to plan for password rotation operations ahead of time rather than dealing with a reactive situation where a password has actually expired.</description></item><item><title>Fixing Expired Passwords on NSX Manager and Edge Nodes</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-nsxt-passwords/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-nsxt-passwords/</guid><description>
By default NSX-T Data Center passwords (root, admin and audit) on the NSX Manager and NSX Edge nodes are set to expire after 90 days. Unless you rotate passwords on regular basis you may have overlooked this default configuration and suddenly find yourself locked out of being able to perform management tasks.
Firstly in more recent releases, VMware Cloud Foundation provides the ability to perform scheduled or manual password rotations something to consider looking into from a day-to-day operational process but if your passwords have already expired all bets are off as the VMware Cloud Foundation password rotation workflow can no longer authenticate.</description></item></channel></rss>
