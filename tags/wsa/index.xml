If you have had VMware Cloud Foundation and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager deployed within your infrastructure for some time you may have noticed in the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Password Locker that there are many passwords called VCF-password-&amp;lt; guid &amp;gt;. This is an internal service account used by vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager to make vCenter Server API calls and is rotated automatically by SDDC Manager.
This duplication of accounts happens due to the fact that there is no way to update the existing record and so SDDC Manager has to create a new account when the rotation process occurs.</description></item><item><title>Fixing Expired Passwords on Workspace ONE Access</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-wsa-passwords/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-wsa-passwords/</guid><description>
By default Workspace ONE Access passwords (root, sshuser) are set to expire after 60 days. Unless you rotate passwords on regular basis you may have overlooked this default configuration and suddenly find yourself locked out of being able to perform management tasks.
VMware Cloud Foundation provides the ability to perform scheduled or manual password rotations something to consider looking into from a day-to-day operational process but if your passwords have already expired this won't help as the VMware Cloud Foundation password rotation workflow can no longer authenticate.</description></item></channel></rss>
