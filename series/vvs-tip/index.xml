Did you know that the PowerShell module PowerValidatedSolution can be used for more than implementing the VMware Validated Solutions?
Whilst the primary goal for the PowerShell module has been to enable a robust and automated way to implement the various procedures across solutions, its very nature unlocks the power for cmdlet's to be used across the VMware portfolio. One of the fundamental directives for our development work was to minimize the reliance on other PowerShell modules.</description></item><item><title>VVS-Tip - Identify What’s Required from a VMware Cloud Foundation Perspective</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-tips/vvs-tip-05/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-tips/vvs-tip-05/</guid><description>

VMware Validated Solutions have been developed so that they can support multiple versions of VMware Cloud Foundation, this means they only need to be updated when absolutely necessary which is typically driven by significant architecture changes.
There are two methods that you can use to identify if a particular solution is supported for the VMware Cloud Foundation release you have deployed.
Method One - Viewing Tags on core.vmware.com VMware utilizes a single landing page within the Cloud Platform Tech Zone website known as core.</description></item></channel></rss>
