The Birth of PowerVCF Back in January 2020 my friend and colleague Brian OConnell embarked on a community project to write a PowerShell module to make consumption of the VMware Cloud Foundation APIs simple and easy to consume by VI Admins, each cmdlet was hand-built using standard PowerShell verbs that the community is well versed in consuming. He saw that the need for automation within our customer based was growing and at the time there was no alternative solution available.</description></item><item><title>What's New for VMware Validated Solutions - Edition #23 (March 2024)</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-23/</guid><description>

This is part three of a four part blog series in which I talk about automating the VMware Cloud Foundation upgrade process. If you have been following the series so far then you will have your bundles downloaded, and performed various health checks to confirm that all is well and will now be ready to start the upgrade process.
Upgrading VMware Cloud Foundation is a multi-stage process, this post will focus on upgrading SDDC Manager which in itself involves two step:</description></item><item><title>Automating VCF Upgrade - Perform Health Checks</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-02/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-02/</guid><description>
This is part two of a four part blog series in which I talk about automating the VMware Cloud Foundation upgrade process. In part one we discussed downloading the bundles to SDDC Manager to prepare the system for the upgrade process, in this post we discuss performing the upgrade pre-checks.
Ensuring your VMware Cloud Foundation instance is healthy prior to starting an upgrade is critical to a successful upgrade, SDDC Manager itself has a pre-check process which is executed on a per workload domain basis.</description></item><item><title>What's New for VMware Validated Solutions - Edition #19 (August 2023)</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-19/</guid><description>

A couple of years ago I wrote a series of blogs (see here) which discussed the process of automating the deployment procedures of VMware Cloud Foundation using the Public APIs, in this new series we will take a look at how we can automate the steps involved in upgrading VMware Cloud Foundation from one release to another.
But before we can begin performing any actual upgrade steps we must carry out some prerequisites which include:</description></item><item><title>Automating VCF Upgrade - Download Release Bundles</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-01/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-automated-upgrade-01/</guid><description>
In order to upgrade VMware Cloud Foundation you must first download the upgrade bundles, I recently wrote a blog Automating the Download of VCF Bundles for a Release on this topic which I shared a script vcfBundleDownload.ps1 which can be downloaded from GitHub which we will utilize as part of the procedure here. The script takes a JSON as input where we define the bundle IDs for download but as part of this post I will share a way to automate that part too.</description></item><item><title>Cleaning Up VCF-password* Accounts from vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-vrslcm-vcf-password/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-vrslcm-vcf-password/</guid><description>
If you have had VMware Cloud Foundation and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager deployed within your infrastructure for some time you may have noticed in the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Password Locker that there are many passwords called VCF-password-&amp;lt; guid &amp;gt;. This is an internal service account used by vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager to make vCenter Server API calls and is rotated automatically by SDDC Manager.
This duplication of accounts happens due to the fact that there is no way to update the existing record and so SDDC Manager has to create a new account when the rotation process occurs.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager with VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-vrslcm-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs/vvs-vrslcm-upgrade/</guid><description>
VMware Cloud Foundation has come a long way in recent years, one of the biggest developments introduced a few releases back centred around the relaxation of a strict Bill of Materials (BoM) as it pertained to the vRealize Suite (see here), the intent being to enable our customers to update the underlying vRealize Suite components faster to adopt new features.
One of the largest and most complex challenges of any integrated software stack is ensuring that the latest and greatest products and features are available to our customers, this is especially so at VMware as we have a number of business groups who own the underlying products consumed by VMware Cloud Foundation.</description></item><item><title>What's New for VMware Validated Solutions - Blog Index</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/whats-new-index/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/whats-new-index/</guid><description>
Last Updated 25-Jul-2023 VMware Validated Solutions are byte sized solutions developed to extend the foundational capabilities of VMware Cloud Foundation, for background reading see my previous post here.

Background In January 2023 through the VMware Validated Solution programme we released both documentation and PowerShell cmdlets to help with the configuration of password policies across the VMware Cloud Foundation platform, enabling our customers to report and configure the password expiration, password complexity, and account lockout policies at scale.
The positive feedback received to date has blown us away and so last month during one of our planning sessions we discussed the merits for spinning out the cmdlets into their own dedicated open-source PowerShell module, during that discussion it was agreed that this would provide us and our customers the following benefits:</description></item><item><title>PowerVCF v2.3.0 - General Availability</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-230/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-230/</guid><description>

Password Policy Configuration may not be that important to some but for security teams it’s critical for ensuring their organization is protected. If you have ever looked deep into this area when it comes to VMware Cloud Foundation and the components involved you will quickly realize that unfortunately VMware today does not make things easy for our customers. We have:
lack of consistency with default values lack of consistency with common parameters lack of consistency with API methods lack of consistency with terminology and language This is why with the January Update to VMware Validated Solutions (see here) we have spent a significant amount of time reviewing and rewriting all aspects of our content as it relates to Password Policy Configuration.</description></item><item><title>What's New for VMware Validated Solutions - Edition #12 (Jan 2023)</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-12/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-12/</guid><description>

VMware Cloud Foundation is an advanced hybrid cloud platform that provides a complete set of software-defined services for compute, storage, networking, security and cloud management to run enterprise apps.
By definition this means that VMware Cloud Foundation consists of a number products from across the VMware portfolio but how do you know your platform is healthy? The obvious answer is to include products such as vRealize Operations or vRealize Log Insight but what if there was a simpler way to gain some insights into the health without the need to implement and manage additional components?</description></item><item><title>What's New for VMware Validated Solutions - Edition #11 (Nov 2022)</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-11/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-11/</guid><description>

With the release of VMware Cloud Foundation 4.5.0 a welcome enhancement to Password Management comes the notification capability, with this new feature we have introduced firstly a new banner that appears in the SDDC Manager UI when an account is identified as disconnected either as a result of the password expiring or the component going offline and secondly a new widget that notifies you when passwords are due to expire. Getting early visibility that passwords are due to expire has a significant impact on the workload of a Site Resiliency Engineer (SRE) in that it allows them to plan for password rotation operations ahead of time rather than dealing with a reactive situation where a password has actually expired.</description></item><item><title>Fixing Expired Passwords on Workspace ONE Access</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-wsa-passwords/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-wsa-passwords/</guid><description>
By default Workspace ONE Access passwords (root, sshuser) are set to expire after 60 days. Unless you rotate passwords on regular basis you may have overlooked this default configuration and suddenly find yourself locked out of being able to perform management tasks.
VMware Cloud Foundation provides the ability to perform scheduled or manual password rotations something to consider looking into from a day-to-day operational process but if your passwords have already expired this won't help as the VMware Cloud Foundation password rotation workflow can no longer authenticate.</description></item><item><title>What's New for VMware Validated Solutions - Edition #10 (Oct 2022)</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-10/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vvs-whats-new/edition-10/</guid><description>

During the last couple of months I've been working on a new project which has given me the opportunity to delve back into Terraform. I first took a look at Terraform in late 2020 while doing some research around automating VMware Validated Solutions, at the time there were far too many gaps in the providers which made it difficult to justify its use to deliver end to end automation with very short time scales.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation and vRealize Suite Flexibility</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-vrealize-flexibility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-vrealize-flexibility/</guid><description>
With the release of VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.0, VMware removed a number of the vRealize Suite of products from the Bill of Materials (BoM) with the intent of providing customers more flexibility. For more details refer to Flexible vRealize Suite product upgrades of the What's New section of the release notes.
Whilst this is great news for our customers, it has led to a bit of confusion. The release notes simply state:</description></item><item><title>Updating a vSAN License in VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-license-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-license-update/</guid><description>
Ever been in the situation where your licenses assigned in VMware Cloud Foundation are due to expire, well whilst doing some work this week in the lab I noticed that some of mine were coming up for expiration, which got me wondering what the process was to remedy. If you have been in this situation, you probably like me started by checking out the License Management section of the VMware Cloud Foundation Administration Guide and like me ended up being disappointed to find that it only covers the following topics:</description></item><item><title>Fixing Expired Passwords on NSX Manager and Edge Nodes</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-nsxt-passwords/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-nsxt-passwords/</guid><description>
By default NSX-T Data Center passwords (root, admin and audit) on the NSX Manager and NSX Edge nodes are set to expire after 90 days. Unless you rotate passwords on regular basis you may have overlooked this default configuration and suddenly find yourself locked out of being able to perform management tasks.
Firstly in more recent releases, VMware Cloud Foundation provides the ability to perform scheduled or manual password rotations something to consider looking into from a day-to-day operational process but if your passwords have already expired all bets are off as the VMware Cloud Foundation password rotation workflow can no longer authenticate.</description></item><item><title>Automating the Download of VCF Bundles for a Release</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-bundle-download/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/vcf/vcf-bundle-download/</guid><description>

Did you know that the PowerShell module PowerValidatedSolution can be used for more than implementing the VMware Validated Solutions?
Whilst the primary goal for the PowerShell module has been to enable a robust and automated way to implement the various procedures across solutions, its very nature unlocks the power for cmdlet's to be used across the VMware portfolio. One of the fundamental directives for our development work was to minimize the reliance on other PowerShell modules.</description></item><item><title>PowerVCF v2.1.7 - General Availability</title><link>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-217/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jadenetworksolutions.co.uk/post/powervcf/powervcf-ga-217/</guid><description>
