I'm pleased to announce the general availability of PowerVCF v2.1.2 for download from the PowerShell Library. PowerVCF is a open source project and the team works on adding support when time permits.

***Download It Here***: [PowerVCF PowerShell Library Download](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowerVCF)

This latest release is a very minor update containing a few bug fixes as well as adding support for the new VIEWER Role added in VMware Cloud Foundation 4.2 within the New-VCFGroup cmdlet.
