When updates are made to [VMware Validated Solutions](https://core.vmware.com/vmware-validated-solutions) the changes could affect a section of the guide or the whole guide, each page within the guide itself has an **Updated** on value at the top of the page.

In addition its possible to identify where content has changed from individual Validated Solution resource page on ***core.vmware.com***, each tile which provides a link to a particular section of the content has a date too, this is updated each time changes are made within that section.
