At VMworld 2019 in the US this year I was lucky enough to be able to present the breakout session **HBI1259BU - Accelerate VMware Cloud Foundation with VMware Cloud Builder** (don't worry if you were not able to attend and will be going to VMworld Europe in Barcelona in November I will be presenting again), during which a did a live demo on how to use PlatformAudit from the command line to speed up troubleshooting. The feedback I got was very positive so decided to write a few blog posts on the topic.
