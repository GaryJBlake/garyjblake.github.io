The question concerning what versions of VMware Validated Design are supported on what versions of VxRail has come up a number of times over the last couple of weeks, as a result we have had a new VMware Support KB article created to track. And for those that were not aware a similar VMware Support KB article already exists for VMware Cloud Foundation on VxRail, links to both KBs are here for future reference.

* [Supported versions of VMware Cloud Foundation on VxRail - KB67854](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/67854)
