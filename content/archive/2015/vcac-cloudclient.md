Do you have the need for performing multiple tasks in an efficient manner, tired of using the web-based GUI interface to perform common tasks in vRealize Automation? Help is at hand in the shape of the vRealize CloudClient.

vRealize CloudClient is a command–line utility that provides simplified command line access to vRealize Automation, vRealize Orchestrator and vCenter Site Recovery Manager functions.  Essentially its an easy to use command-line wrapper for performing API functions across VMware's products and can easily be expanded to extend to further products in the future. It can be downloaded from here and is shipped independently from the vRealize Automation Release.

A number of my colleagues have written some great blog posts over the last few months (see below) and I plan to add some very specific use cases of my own on this site in the coming months based on my day-to-day job.
