I work at VMware by Broadcom based in the UK as a Distinguished Platform Engineering Architect within the VMware Cloud Foundation Division (VCF) in a global team responsible for the solution design for VMware Cloud Foundation, VMware Validated Design and Solutions. I have been working in the IT industry for over 30+ years spending a large amount of this time working for various consulting organizations. Since 2005 I have specialized in Virtualization technologies. My blog is used to simply share my experiences and knowledge with others.
