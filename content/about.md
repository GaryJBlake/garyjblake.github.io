I work at VMware in the UK as a Senior Staff Solution Architect within the Cloud Infrastructure Business Group (CIBG) which is a global team responsible for the solution design for VMware Cloud Foundation, VMware Validated Solutions. I have been working in the IT industry for over 20+ years spending a large amount of this time working for various consulting organizations. Since 2005 I have specialized in Virtualization technologies. My blog is used to simply share my experiences and knowledge with others.
