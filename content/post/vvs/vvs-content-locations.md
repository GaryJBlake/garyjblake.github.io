Since the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom there has been a significant amount of effort behind the scenes to consolidate systems, processes and portals, as a result of this work a couple of key areas have been affected that impact VMware Validated Solutions. If as a result you have been struggling to find the content then read on!

### VMware Validated Solutions Landing Page

When we first launched VMware Validated Solutions back in October 2021 we decided to utilize one of the Technical Marketing portals known as TechZone and in particular the core.vmware.com TechZone portal, this provided more flexibility in how we could lay out the content helping direct customers to the relevant content based on their task at hand. The TechZone portal was shutdown in November 2024, and so we looked at how we could provide a similar experience. If your familiar with VMware Validated Solutions you will be aware of the automation we have delivered across solutions and no doubt be aware of a couple of GitHub repositories that exist to support this effort and so we have created a documentation landing page within the companion GitHub repository [VMware Validated Solutions](https://vmware.github.io/validated-solutions-for-cloud-foundation/).

The image below shows the main landing page, where each validated solution just like on TechZone is represented by a tile. Clicking `View Resources` for a specific solution will present you with a dropdown and then links to the relevant section of the content. Clicking the main tile for a validated solution will take you to the top of the solution guide.

### Solution Guide Content

The main solution guide content was hosted under the VMware Technical Documentation portal known as docs.vmware.com, in January 2025 this was replaced with the Broadcom Technical Documentation portal known as [techdocs.broadcom.com](techdocs.broadcom.com). Once you land on the main Broadcom Technical Documentation portal you must navigate to the VMware Validated Solution tile as follows:

1. On the **VMware Cloud Infrastructure Software** tile, click **View More**.
2. On the **VMware Cloud Foundation** tile, click **View More**.
3. On the **VMware Validated Solutions** tile, click **View More**.
4. From here you can click the tile of the validated solution you want.
