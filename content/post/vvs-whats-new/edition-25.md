### Importing the VMware Aria Suite OVA files into a vSphere Content Library

Following the Broadcom acquisition, the VMware Customer Connect website has been replaced with the Broadcom Support Portal and as part of this change VMware Aria Suite Lifecycle has currently lost the ability to download the VMware Aria Suite OVAs directly from the site resulting in a new multi-step process to inject the OVAs into VMware Aria Suite Lifecycle. For this reason, the validated solutions have chosen to utilize a vSphere Content Library which in our opinion simplifies the process slightly but is also the best method to use when running nested environments within lab setups. 

* Intelligent Logging and Analytics, see [Import the VMware Aria Operations for Logs OVA to vSphere Content Library for Intelligent Logging and Analytics for VMware Cloud Foundation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/vcf-intelligent-logging-and-analytics-v1/GUID-F476B605-B7EB-40D4-851E-A4B01C99FAB0.html)

### Signed Certificate Generation using the PowerShell Module for VMware Validated Solutions

First introduced as part the PowerValidatedSolutions v2.10.0, the manual implementation procedures now include the use of PowerShell cmdlets included as part of the PowerShell Module for VMware Validated Solutions over the use of [CertGenVVS](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/322377/certificate-generation-utility-for-vmwar.html) script.

### General Availability of PowerValidatedSolutions v2.11.0

* [Documentation](https://vmware-samples.github.io/power-validated-solutions-for-cloud-foundation/)
* [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowerValidatedSolutions/2.11.0)
* [GitHub Project](https://github.com/vmware-samples/power-validated-solutions-for-cloud-foundation)

A PowerShell module that has been written to support the automation of many procedures associated with the implementation of the [VMware Validated Solutions](https://vmware.com/go/vvs) for [VMware Cloud Foundation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation).

The module helps reduce human error, delivers consistency and robustness, and accelerates the time-to-deploy these solutions. The module's cmdlets reduce complexity by automating the deployment and configuration steps using the product APIs or command-line tools.

**Release Highlights**

* Bug fixes and enhancements.
* End-to-end automation for solution interoperability.
* Additional automation to support VMware Aria Operations for Networks.
