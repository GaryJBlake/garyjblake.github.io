### vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Upgrade

Almost a year ago now VMware Cloud Foundation introduced the concept of a flexible bill of materials (BoM) for the vRealize Suite of products, what this essential meant was that other than vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager no other vRealize Suite product are defined based on the VMware Cloud Foundation release BoM. This has been great for customers as they have been able to move faster through releases without the need to wait for an upgrade of VMware Cloud Foundation, the only limitation being that they are tied to what vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager supports based on what product support pack is installed.

Getting a customer to the latest supported product is now confusing with multiple releases and product support packs that are available and for the VMware Validated Solutions its getting hard to keep track of the various procedures based on product versions as minor changes come in around the UI procedures.

For this release we took the decision to provide additional content to help customers get to a defined starting point regardless of VMware Cloud Foundation they are implementing (v4.5.1 or v5.0.0), for this a new section has been added prior to implementing the main components of the solution where we direct you to the correct content for performing the tasks required to get vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager to v8.10.0 Patch 1 with product support pack 14.
